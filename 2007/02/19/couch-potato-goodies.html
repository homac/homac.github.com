<p>
As briefly mentioned last time, I got a developer code for a <a href="http://www.nokia.com/n800">Nokia n800</a>. Thanks. I already had a n770, so without further ado, I decided to
purchase one. And that really kept me on the go the last couple of
weeks. At home, my computer is connected to my stereo system to play my
mp3s with passable good sound. So having a n800 with wlan, I thought
there has to be a possibility to use it as remote control. Looking for
something at the web, I shortly found the <a href="http://www.musicpd.org">Music Player Daemon (mpd)</a> to
be used as a service running on my home computer managing and playing my
mp3 collection. And very easy to install. Well, first duty was to find a
good client that works on the n800. Trying two web based clients and
noticing that they are ugly was not really satisfying. It was not hard
to build the <a href="http://www.musicpd.org/gmpc.shtml">Gnome Music Player Client</a> with some small modifications
inside my scratchbox environment for the <a href="http://www.maemo.org">Maemo</a> platform. Too bad for me,
the GUI is optimised for higher screen resolutions and for multi
windowed systems.
</p>
<p>
The default multimedia player which comes along with the n800 is quite
nice IMO, so an interface similar to this would be best. Well, noticing
that Nokia didn't open source its code although there's a request from
within the community is quite disappointing. I thought they wouldn't do
things by halves, but, well, other story&hellip; Hopefully there's at least
no patent or the like for the GUI, otherwise I just hope they won't sue
me for reverse engineering it ;-)
</p>
<p>
Writing my first own gtk application was quite exhausting. The
documentation is so horrible bad :-( I just wonder why there aren't more
tutorials out there. For instance, about IMHO common problems like
setting bold font of a row in a GtkTreeView. Well, after getting into
it, it was, hm, well, O.k. ;-)
</p>
<p>
So here it is:

<img src="http://mmpc.garage.maemo.org/images/playing_1.png"  alt="http://mmpc.garage.maemo.org/images/playing_1.png" />
</p>
<p>
It is based on the <a href="http://sarine.nl/gmpc">Gnome Music Player Client</a>, but has undergone quite
much modification like hildonization, Maemo menus, the new player
interface, etc&hellip; The GUI got especially designed to be used as a remote
control, meaning that it should be good to use without the stylus. All
in all, it is more a fork than a port. The first couple of days really
show the huge interest in an application like this. At the time of
writing this, there are already 281 downloads as you can see on the
Maemo garage <a href="https://garage.maemo.org/frs/?group_id=193"> project page</a>. It's a great toy ;-)
</p>
<p>
Actually I had another cool feature in mind. The device being used as a
remote control, and only as a remote control, you do not want other
people using or seeing any other things on the device while managing
music. So I actually wanted to force fullscreen mode until a correct
password gets entered. The code is already finished, but there's one
problem. The actual user can just turn off the device and reboot ;-) So
anyone having any idea how to prevent the user to reboot the device?
There's no possibility to lock the device in a way that one has to enter
a password everytime the device boots. Something like a PIN in cell
phones would be good. I can catch the hardware button event, of course,
but the system is turned off in any case. Different story&hellip;
</p>
<p>
What I'm currently looking for is a graphic designer. I'm usually not
very good at that. So someone out there either doing web design or is
willing and able to design some nice play, stop, forward, backward,
etc. buttons? Any help would be appreciated. In any case, visit the
<a href="http://mmpc.garage.maemo.org">homepage</a> for more information.
