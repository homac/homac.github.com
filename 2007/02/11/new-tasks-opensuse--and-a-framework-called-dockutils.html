<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">


<p>
Long time no post, and a lot of things happened. At least to me. Forgot
to mention last time, for anyone interested, I started college at the
<a href="http://www.uni-erlangen.org/">Friedrich-Alexander-University of Erlangen-Nuremberg</a> in middle of
october with course of studies in computer science. On Friday, the
winter semester was over - finally. Learning all this difficult and
completely new stuff is quite different from what I've been doing the
last couple of years at SUSE. So I was really busy the last months to
reconcile university and my work on linux ;-)
</p>
<p>
Well, but my time at SUSE isn't over, of course, still working there at
regular times, just not that much like before. And therefore, I wasn't
able to be as active in regard to linux as I hoped to be. You can't be
very innovative, you just have to do the things that have to be
done. Working on bugs, handling mail, etc.. I'll have two exams in
middle of March, though, but except from that, until the new semester
starts, I will be able to work fulltime on linux.

<p>
Nevertheless, openSUSE 10.2 was released during this time, and I finally
finished the power management redesign <a href="http://forge.novell.com/pipermail/powersave-devel/2006-June/000589.html">announced</a> some time ago. Doing
stuff like integrating pm-utils, the CPUFreq HAL addon, adjusting the
powersave daemon or failing to get more involved in kpowersave's future
development.
</p>
<p>
Not to forget about <a href="http://dockutils.sourceforge.net">dockutils</a>, a framework, or better, a collection of
scripts providing an infrastructure to easily trigger actions on
docking/undocking requests for different laptops and vendors. To quote
the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Dockutils">openSUSE wiki page</a> where you can find more information, it shall be
the following, not more and not less:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide infrastructure to do userspace stuff that has to be done on
    dock and undock
</li>
<li>Provide easy to use infrastructure for hardware vendors,
    distributors or users to get proper docking station support or to do
    just anything they like on dock/undock, for instance starting a
    special tool or just displaying a message on the desktop.
</li>
<li>Provide infrastructure for nasty and ugly workarounds either because
    of broken hardware, bugs or just because of a lack of support in the
    kernel
</li>
</ul>


<p>
There are some basic scripts already included, at least to get the X60
dock station and some other Thinkpads working, but there's also still
lot to do. Some days ago I registered <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dockutils/">a project</a> at sourceforge. I'm not
even sure if dockutils prevails itself, but I needed a place to host the
code, and I did not want to just include it in the openSUSE rpms. So if
you like to have a look at it, check it out:
</p>

<p>
 svn co <a href="https://dockutils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/dockutils">https://dockutils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/dockutils</a> dockutils
</p>

<p>
Just to prevent questions: Yes, I know that there is a new generic dock
station driver (and bay driver) in recent kernels, and yes, I already
got familiar with it, and yes, I will do the integration into HAL and
openSUSE very soon ;-)
</p>
<p>
Unfortunatelly, we get rare feedback on docking. Therefore I like to ask
some questions:
</p>
<p>
Do you have a docking station? Does it work for you? Does it work
combined with suspend/resume? Does the hardware included in the dock
station work after docking/undocking? Do you have a workaround or a
script to get it working? Please drop a comment, send me a mail or
create a bugreport if you can answer any of the above
questions. Otherwise it will be nearly impossible to improve docking
station support. You can find my email at the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Dockutils#How_to_contribute">openSUSE</a>. Thanks.
</p>
<p>
Next post will follow very soon, because I will have to write something
very exciting (at least to me) regarding the Nokia n800 I received a
developer code for, thanks Nokia!
