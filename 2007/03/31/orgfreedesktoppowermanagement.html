<p>
There's currently a <a href="http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xdg/2007-March/009489.html">discussion on the xdg@freedesktop.org list</a> started
by <a href="http://hughsient.livejournal.com/">Richard Hughes</a> about a common org.freedesktop.PowerManagement
interface <a href="http://people.freedesktop.org/~hughsient/temp/power_management-spec-0.1.html">(first draft available)</a> which will hopefully become cross
desktop. Currently it includes methods like:
</p>
<ul>
<li>org.freedesktop.PowerManagement.Shutdown()
</li>
<li>org.freedesktop.PowerManagement.Reboot()
</li>
<li>org.freedesktop.PowerManagement.Suspend()
</li>
<li>org.freedesktop.PowerManagement.Suspend()
</li>
<li>org.freedesktop.PowerManagement.GetOnBattery()
</li>
<li>&hellip;
</li>
</ul>


<p>
Well, this all sounds very good, no? Of course it does, and it is!
There's already a lot agreemennt on the most of those methods from both
sides, KDE and GNOME which is really great.
</p>
<p>
But there's one problem I'm currently seeing. In my opinion, it would be
better to define two methods Shutdown() and Reboot() somewhere in the
desktop base (something like org.freedesktop.Desktop) in the future
(KDE4, GNOME 3.0, etc&hellip;). I indeed think that they are in the scope of
power management, but still have some kind of exceptional
position. Having them tied to the o.f.PM interface, and more important,
the methods being compulsory, would force the desktop to always
implement all methods of the interface. Do you get the idea?
</p>
<p>
So if you don't have a power management application such as kpowersave
or gnome-power-manager the desktop itself would have to implement all
the other methods like Suspend() or Hibernate(), which seems strange to
me, especially in regard to usual desktop systems. You sometimes just
don't need them. To rephrase it a little bit, some people might just not
want them for whatever reasons. Having the Shutdown() and Reboot()
methods methods compulsory will make it very hard to split them out in
future.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, in current implementations, both kpowersave and gnome power
manager just call the logout mechanism of "their" desktop, which
involved saving the session etc. Applications could just call the logout
mechanisms themselves instead of handing them over to a interface which
then again hands them over to someone else, no?
</p>
<p>
Currently gnome-power-manager is very well integrated into GNOME. For
instance, if there's not battery or other laptop specific capabilities,
the icon just disappears. So one could argue that g-p-m is a direct part
of the desktop base. Not so for KDE. KDE currently doesn't have a clever
power management application by default. However, I really like to see
kpowersave in KDE default in the near future, but that's another story.
</p>
<p>
Ideally, IMHO, it should look as follows in the future:
</p>
<p>
Having a base interface org.freedesktop.Desktop which carries out
methods like Shutdown(), Reboot(), Logout() or Session.Save(). And on
top of it there should be something like
org.freedesktop.Desktop.PowerManagement.Suspend() and the like:
</p>
<ul>
<li>org.freedesktop.Desktop
</li>
<li>org.freedesktop.Desktop.Shutdown()
</li>
<li>org.freedesktop.Desktop.Reboot()
</li>
<li>org.freedesktop.Desktop.Session.Save()
</li>
<li>org.freedesktop.Desktop.PowerManagement.Suspend()
</li>
<li>org.freedesktop.Desktop.PowerManagement.GetOnBattery()
</li>
</ul>


<p>
One could of course just let the word "Desktop" slip, that's an
implementation detail.
</p>
<p>
The first four methods get served by the desktop base, the last two by a
power management application if one available.
</p>
<p>
It seems that this proposal already got some agreement from a some
people both from the KDE and GNOME community. Intefaces might be called
org.freedesktop.SessionManagement.Shutdown() (same for Reboot()) and
org.freedesktop.PowerManagement.*. But that is still to be defined.
</p>
<p>
Comments and opinions would be welcome!
