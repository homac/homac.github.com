<h2 id="sec-1">Post-Mortem Memory Analysis of Cold-Booted Android Devices</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Although the <a href="http://www1.gi-ev.de/fachbereiche/sicherheit/fg/sidar/imf/imf2014/">IMF 2014</a> already took place over a month ago, it is still
time to mention the publication which has been presented there:
</p>

<p>
<b>Post-Mortem Memory Analysis of Cold-Booted Android Devices</b>
</p>

<p>
Both the <a href="http://www.homac.de/publications/Post-Mortem-Memory-Analysis-of-Cold-Booted-Android-Devices.pdf">paper</a> and the corresponding <a href="http://www.homac.de/publications/Post-Mortem-Memory-Analysis-of-Cold-Booted-Android-Devices-slides.pdf">presentation slides</a> are online
(click links or see <a href="http://www.homac.de/publications.html">publications</a>).
</p>

<p>
The paper was created in cooperation with the <a href="https://www4.cs.fau.de/">Department of Computer
Science</a> at the Friedrich-Alexander-University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. I
herewith thank the other authors Christian Hilgers, Tilo MÃ¼ller and
Michael Spreitzenbarth. Especially for presenting the paper in my
absence.

<h2 id="sec-2">Mirrored / Gespiegelt - Android App Updated</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Well, never actually blogged about this one. Although the project's
initial release has been done in late 2010. It basically started as a
proof of concept to see what those Android apps are all about. And it
was a good exercise for doing some Java I used to need at university
that time.
</p>

<p>
So what is it all about? Mirrored (German name "Gespiegelt") is a simple
news reader to read the articles posted on <a href="http://www.spiegel.de">Spiegel Online</a>. What is
special about it? It has been around even before the <a href="http://www.spiegel.de">Spiegel</a> published
the official application. Though there is more, it has the capability to
download and save the articles to read them offline. Comes in handy when
having no internet flat rate or being on the subway without proper
broadband people tell in comments.
</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>
Anyway, it is up on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.homac.Mirrored">Google Play</a> and can be installed from your favorite
Android device. The source code and more information is available on
<a href="https://gitorious.org/mirrored/pages/Home">Gitorious</a>.
</p>

<p>
I just released version 0.2.5 fixing a bug in offline storage and a
minor menu alignment issue caused by the latest design changes. Bug
fixing, let me call it maintenance instead, is basically everything I do
for Mirrored though. It is feature complete and my personal motivation
for doing high level programming with Java is rather low.
</p>

<p>
So last but not least, let me seize the chance to thank <a href="https://gitorious.org/~framas">Frank Scheffold</a>
and <a href="https://gitorious.org/~doccrazy">Doccrazy</a> for their bug fixing and improvements during the last
couple of years. I am really grateful for any patches or improvements I
receive. Even if someone would like to take over maintainership, go for
it.

<p>
URfkill 0.4 has been released for quite some time now. However, I've
been quite busy the last couple of months so I didn't make it to port
the python-killswitch module to the new DBus API. Until now, until I've
finally releasing python-killswitch 0.4 which is basically fixing <a href="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=734894">SUSE

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Quite surprised by receiving yet another feature request about the
<i>Maemo Music Player Client</i> for the Maemo platform. I always got some
mails here and then, but didn't receive one in quite a while. But just
that everybody knows:
</p>

<p>
<b>I hereby declare</b> <a href="http://mmpc.garage.maemo.org">MMPC</a> <b>officially unsupported, not to say dead, stone-dead in particular.</b>
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, it's nice to hear that the project still has (at least a
few) users, so that I can say it has been a success after all.

<h2 id="sec-5">Saving Power with a new Killswitch Applet</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
So there has been <a href="https://features.opensuse.org/hackweek">Hackweek</a> at SUSE/Novell the last week and I'm finally
finding the time to release a new version of <a href="http://gitorious.org/python-killswitch/killswitch-applet">killswitch-applet</a>. This
time, it's version 0.2.3, and really a lot has changed from the previous
<a href="http://blog.homac.de/2009/04/17/killswitch-applet----or-my-personal-hello-world-in-python.html">0.1 release</a>:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The applet remembers your settings across reboots

<p>
That is actually <b>the</b> feature which makes you want killswitch-applet
at all. Without the applet, whenever you disable a device, let's say
bluetooth, after a reboot, the device is active again. I'm assuming
two prerequisites here:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>You're not using a Thinkpad laptop, because those are the only
ones I know of (please enlighten me if you know of others) which
are able to store the state of their devices in
NVRAM. Speficically, the thinkpad-acpi driver is able to do so.
</li>

<li>Your laptop doesn't have a physical hardware switch for
enabling/disabling bluetooth/wifi. This hardware switch might also
be hidden after a usual button which doesn't look like it is
handled in hardware.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
All other laptop owners might find killswitch-applet very useful. If
you're the owner of let's say, a sony, HP, Acer, or whatever laptop,
you would have to disable the bluetooth device over and over again
after each reboot. Maybe even after a sleep, depending on the
hardware configuration, distribution, kernel version, etc.. These
unnecessary mouse clicks are just avoided. Disabling the bluetooth
device once will take care that it is disabled the next time
killswitch-applet starts, which is mostly when you're doing a reboot
and/or logging in to your desktop.
</p>
</li>

<li>Vector graphic (svg) is used for the tray icon, which makes it scale
nicely for whatever panel (kicker, gnome-applet, etc.) you're using.
</li>

<li>Add tool tip to get a fast overview about which killswitches are
active.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sec-6">z-shell (zsh) completion for osc and zypper</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
When working with the <a href="http://www.opensuse.org">openSUSE</a> distribution, there are a couple of tools
you have to deal with over and over again. Two of them are <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Osc">osc</a> and
<a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Zypper">zypper</a>. The first one to build or fix packages, the latter to install,
remove or update them. Using one of those tools on a regular basis? Read
on&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&#x2026;but to make this post actually useful for you, there needs to be
another prerequisite: You need to use zsh as your primary shell. And I
hope you do. If not, you should definitely put this on your TODO list.
</p>

<p>
All of the following is ready to use, because it's already in openSUSE
Factory for quite some time and has already been in openSUSE 11.2. I
just have the feeling that people are not aware of this feature, so I am
writing this post&#x2026;
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-6-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-6-1">osc</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-1">
<p>
So let's start with osc. There are a couple of sub commands like
<i>checkout</i>, <i>getbinaries</i> or <i>branch</i> I need all the time. And every
time I do, I have to look up the syntax. For instance, have a look at
the <i>osc getbinaries</i> command:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">$ osc help getbinaries
osc getbinaries PROJECT PACKAGE REPOSITORY ARCHITECTURE
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Hm? Four parameters? Things like that were actually the reason I sat
down implementing a solution which works quite well for me: Zsh
completion for osc. Now you can do stuff like the following:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">$ osc getbinaries &lt;tab&gt;
home:hmacht              openSUSE:11.0            openSUSE:11.3            SUSE:SLE-11:Update:Test
home:hmacht:kernel-sony  openSUSE:11.1            openSUSE:Factory
openSUSE:10.3            openSUSE:11.2            SUSE:SLE-11-SP1:GA

$ osc getbinaries openSUSE:Factory aaa_base &lt;tab&gt;
openSUSE_10.2     openSUSE_11.0     openSUSE_11.2     openSUSE_Factory  SUSE_SLE-11_GA
openSUSE_10.3     openSUSE_11.1     openSUSE_11.3     standard

$ osc getbinaries openSUSE:Factory aaa_base openSUSE_Factory
i586    x86_64
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Quite handy, isn't it?
</p>

<p>
You might also wonder why the first completion output in the above
example contains my personal home project <i>home:hmacht</i>. By default, the
completion contains a couple of default build targets, repositories and
architectures like <i>openSUSE\<sub>Factory</sub></i>, <i>openSUSE:Factory</i> or
<i>x86\<sub>64</sub></i>. You can extend those lists with the shell variables
<i>ZSH\<sub>OSC</sub>\<sub>PROJECTS</sub>\<sub>EXTRA</sub></i> and <i>ZSH\<sub>OSC</sub>\<sub>BUILD</sub>\<sub>TARGETS</sub>\<sub>EXTRA</sub></i>. My
corresponding part of my ~/.zshrc looks so:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">export ZSH_OSC_PROJECTS_EXTRA="home:hmacht home:hmacht:kernel-sony SUSE:SLE-11:Update:Test SUSE:SLE-11-SP1:GA"
export ZSH_OSC_BUILD_TARGETS_EXTRA="standard SUSE_SLE-11_GA"
</pre>
</div>

<p>
After that, the extra repos/targets show up in the completion output.
</p>

<p>
By default, the completion is in <i>verbose mode</i>:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">$ osc &lt;tab&gt;
--debugger             -- jump into the debugger before executing anything
--no-keyring           -- disable usage of desktop keyring system
--post-mortem          -- jump into the debugger in case of errors
--version              -- show program's version number and exit
-A                     -- URL/alias, --apiurl=URL/alias
-H                     -- --http-debug debug HTTP traffic
-c                     -- FILE, --config=FILE
-d                     -- --debug print info useful for debugging
-h                     -- --help show this help message and exit
-q                     -- --quiet be quiet, not verbose
-t                     -- --traceback print call trace in case of errors
-v                     -- --verbose increase verbosity
abortbuild             -- Aborts the build of a certain project/package
add                    -- Mark files to be added upon the next commit
addremove              -- (ar) Adds new files, removes disappeared files
aggregatepac           -- "Aggregate" a package to another package
api                    -- Issue an arbitrary request to the API
branch                 -- (bco, branchco, getpac)
bugowner               -- Show bugowners of a project/package
build                  -- Build a package on your local machine
[...]
</pre>
</div>

<p>
To change that you can set
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">$ zstyle ':completion:*:osc:*' verbose no
$ zstyle ':completion:*:osc-subcommand:*' verbose no
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now it looks like:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">$ osc &lt;tab&gt;
--debugger             api                    diff                   meta                   resolved
--no-keyring           branch                 disable                mkpac                  results
--post-mortem          bugowner               getbinaries            mv                     rremove
--version              build                  global                 my                     search
[...]
</pre>
</div>

<p>
All the completion output is auto generated by the <i>osc help</i> output
(btw., even <i>osc help &lt;tab&gt;</i> can be completed), so new commands should
show up automatically. However, this contains the risk of possible bugs
where the help output is unexpected, so if you find any issues, send me
a mail or add a comment.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-6-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-6-2">zypper</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-2">
<p>
Basically all the above applies for <i>zypper</i>. An example output looks like:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">$ zypper re&lt;tab&gt;
refresh                 -- ref Refresh all repositories.
refresh-services        -- refs Refresh all services.
remove                  -- rm Remove packages.
removelock              -- rl Remove a package lock.
removerepo              -- rr Remove specified repository.
removeservice           -- rs Remove specified service.
renamerepo              -- nr Rename specified repository.
repos                   -- lr List all defined repositories.
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Change verbose/short output with:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-bash">$ zstyle ':completion:*:osc:*' verbose no
$ zstyle ':completion:*:osc-subcommand:*' verbose no
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Personally I use the zypper completion quite seldom, nevertheless, some
people might find it useful.

<h2 id="sec-8">killswitch-applet-0.1 &#x2026;  or my personal Hello World in Python</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
<p>
One thing that was on my TODO for already quite some time was to have a
look at that half-new language called Python. Because an old-fashioned
"Hello World" is far too simple here, I was looking for some kind of
project to get familiar with the basic principles.
</p>

<p>
One thing I found quite annoying in the past was the fact that I always
had to disable some kind of radios in some far too complicated ways to
save some battery power. Modern laptops often have multiple killswitches
for their wireless communication devices like bluetooth, WLAN or
WWAN. So that was the chance for me to seize, and the output looks like
this:

killswitch-applet is a small application sitting in the system tray
providing the possibility to manage all the killswitches found in the
system. In this context, "managing" means enabling or disabling certain
killswitches. This is especially useful if you have multiple
killswitches like bluetooth, WWAN or WLAN seen in many modern laptops.

The source tarball for version 0.1 can be downloaded here:
<a href="http://www.homac.de/files/killswitch-applet-0.1.tar.gz">killswitch-applet-0.1</a>
</p>

<p>
The summary here definitely is: Wow, that was damn simple! Especially
when it comes down to GTK programming and D-Bus interaction, Python
definitely provides a very good way to hack those things together quite
easily. The whole source file contains a whole of 189 lines of code
including comments.
</p>

<p>
Another question: Is it worth creating a sourceforge project for this?
I'll wait until and if I'm getting some feedback.

<p>
Inspired by a recent <a href="http://www.figuiere.net/hub/blog/?2009/04/15/660-gnote-012">blog post</a>, <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Gnote">Gnote</a> is now available in the openSUSE
build service. If you have been using Tomboy and wouldn't miss any of
its plugins (which are WIP), give it a try. The Mono to C++ conversion
can be that easy:
</p>



<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For Factory: $ zypper ar \
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/hmacht/openSUSE_Factory/">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/hmacht/openSUSE_Factory/</a>
\ home:hmacht
</p>



<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For 11.1: $ zypper ar \
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/hmacht/openSUSE_11.1/">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/hmacht/openSUSE_11.1/</a>
\ home:hmacht
</p>



<ul class="org-ul">
<li>$ zypper in gnote
</li>
</ul>



<ul class="org-ul">
<li>$ mkdir ~/.gnote &amp;&amp; cp ~/.tomboy/*.note ~/.gnote/
</li>
</ul>



<ul class="org-ul">
<li>$ gnote
</li>
</ul>




<p>
AFAICT, it's running quite well. Tomboy has been the only Mono
application I was running, so 'zypper remove mono' removed a bunch of 42
packages.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-10">

<p>
Finally I took the time to respond to multiple requests about providing
<a href="http://mmpc.garage.maemo.org">mmpc 0.2.1</a> packages for Diablo. That also gave me the possibility to try
the <a href="https://garage.maemo.org/extras-assistant/index.php">maemo autobuilder</a> to upload my packages to the <a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/Uploading_to_Extras">extras
repository</a>. And well, it worked out. It's especially useful for those
people not running debian based systems, because with autobuilder you
don't have to care about signing and uploading the packages with debian
tools like debsign and dput.
</p>

<p>
So, this is not a new release, these are just new packages build for the

<p>
In the middle of last year, I participated in a seminar called "GreenIT"
at university. The result was a 17 paged whitepaper called <a href="http://www.homac.de/files/Power_Consumption_and_-Optimization_of_PCs.pdf">"GreenIT:
Power Consumption and -Optimization of PCs"</a>. It took quite some time to
finish this up, so it would be a waste of time if I would not publish
it. A shortened table of contents looks like this:

Please note: If you are only interested in how things are implemented in
Linux, this might not be that interesting for you. It does not include
any specific operating system details. It's rather general, although of
a technical nature, and thus can be applied to any operating system out
there.

If you are lazy of reading through the whole document, you might
consider having a look at the corresponding <a href="http://www.homac.de/files/Power_Consumption_and_-Optimization_of_PCs-presentation.pdf">presentation

German language for the slides to be useful for you.

<p>
Finally I managed to release gnome-docker 0.1, a small application to
support users using a docking station. It is already included in
<a href="http://www.opensuse.org">openSUSE</a> 11.0, but other pending things prevented me to do a public
release earlier. One of these things is the self designed tray
icon :-). I definitely have to look for a better alternative. The README
should have all the necessary information:
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-12-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-12-1">GNOME docker 0.1</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-12-1">
<p>
GNOME application for notifying laptop users about the state of their
dock station and the possibility to undock the system via software,
either from the tray icon, or via a hotkey. In future, it will also care
about hotpluggable devices placed on the dock station, such as hard
drives and DVD/CD drives.
</p>

<p>
It is meant to be well designed and to fit into the GNOME desktop. So an
important aim for gnome-docker is to be shipped with GNOME upstream. It
is still in early development.
</p>

<p>
Currently, it has the following features:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>tray icon showing the current status and with functionality to
undock a laptop
</li>
<li>handling of hotkeys to undock a laptop (e.g. FN-F9 on ThinkPads)
</li>
<li>xrandr support to enable/disable external outputs attached to the
dock station (experimental, evaluating how it fits there)
</li>
<li>user notifications about the state of the dock station. E.g.: "Now
it's safe to remove the laptop"
</li>
</ul>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://blog.homac.de/images/gnome-docker-pointer.png" alt="gnome-docker-pointer.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
As gnome-docker forges ahead, the linux kernel has to improve and has to
provide sensible date for userspace to make use of, like exporting which
devices are inside a dock station.

Came back from <a href="http://www.linuxtag.org/2008/">Linux Tag 2008</a> on saturday evening. It was a short, only
two days lasting trip to Berlin, but nevertheless, just great! Had a lot
of fun with my colleagues <a href="http://blog.nouse.net">Timo Hoenig</a> and <a href="http://trinkteufel.de/">Helmut Schaa</a> giving a talk
about laptop support in the upcoming openSUSE 11.0. It was a huge
success. Great thanks goes to Martin Lasarsch for managing/moderating
our talk. The quiz at the end giving away some USB sticks for correct
answers has been just fun. It seems people are really listening to our
laptops stories, or should we better not have told them at the beginning
that there will be give-aways? ;-)

<h2 id="sec-14">Providing a D-Bus interface for CPUFreq knobs</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-14">
<p>
There has been a discussion on the HAL development list regarding
DeviceKit, a corresponding power management subsystem daemon, and a
possible CPU frequency scaling interface.
</p>

<p>
During the discussion, it turned out, and I realised this quite late,
that KPowersave still exports the possibility to set either the
powersave or performance governor. That is basically a bad idea, and
still there because of former times. See this <a href="http://mjg59.livejournal.com/2008/05/08/">journal</a> for a good
rationale. However, the author quite unfriendly rants towards the
developers. Unfortunately, I've not seen a bugreport in <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=124576&atid=700009">sourceforge's
bugtracker</a> for that, nor anywhere else. Maybe he could have pointed this
out in a more elegant way, instead of immediately telling people they
are dangerous. How emotional. And funny after all. I filed it <a href="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=389049">here</a>, just
to be sure it is not missed for upcoming openSUSE 11.0.
</p>

<p>
So that is the one issue of the discussion, a completely other one is
about if we need a D-Bus interface for tuning CPU frequency scaling
(related to the ondemand governor) knobs. As an example, the ondemand
governor provides an up<sub>threshold</sub> setting you can tune through
sysfs. Basically it defines how long a CPU burst has to be so that the
frequency is increased. Quoting the kernel documentation:
</p>


<p>
up<sub>threshold</sub>: defines what the average CPU usaged between the
samplings of 'sampling<sub>rate</sub>' needs to be for the kernel to make a
decision on whether it should increase the frequency.  For example
when it is set to its default value of '80' it means that between
the checking intervals the CPU needs to be on average more than 80%
in use to then decide that the CPU frequency needs to be increased.
</p>


<p>
When having only short CPU bursts, it is better to stay at a low
frequency for a short period of time when it comes down to power
consumption. And the typical desktop use consists of those short CPU
bursts. Browsing a web page, opening a mail folder, etc.
</p>

<p>
The kernel sets a sane default for this setting. It is nearly
self-evident for a default to be sane, someone should have thought
carefully about it. However, that does not mean it is ideal. It just
cannot be for all different kind of use cases. Servers, desktops, what
applications are running, "on battery", "on AC", namely, depending on
the current power source.
</p>

<p>
So I am an advocator of having a D-Bus interface somewhere at the system
level (we already have in HAL, but this will most likely vanish sooner
or later due to its successor called DeviceKit) for tuning such knobs by
someone who cares about policy. And policy is more and more put to
Desktop applications these days.

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://mmpc.garage.maemo.org/images/mmpc.png" alt="mmpc.png" />

</div>

<p>
Well, mmpc-0.2.1 is available for immediate consumption. Changes, which
were major concerns until now, are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>New buttons and images, finally. And a new logo you can see above.
</li>
<li>Add tap-and-hold functionality to more places. For example, it's now
possible to update the database from within the client.
</li>
<li>Add scroll windows to all preference tabs to display the full
content.
</li>
<li>Bold the currently played track.
</li>
<li>Increase connection timeout to 3 seconds. This will hopefully solve
the strange disconnect issues I wasn't able to reproduce.
</li>
<li>Fixed tree browsing in playlist browser.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Fresh screenshots can be found <a href="http://mmpc.garage.maemo.org">here</a>. Packages are available from the
extras repository. So most people will get the update automatically (if
anything goes wrong, try to enable red pill mode). Otherwise, grab them
from <a href="https://garage.maemo.org/frs/?group_id=193">garage</a>.

Next things will include the support for some plugins. Please report any

Ever wondered what the Energy Star label is good for? Ever wondered why
it mostly pops up on things like printers and monitors? But how about
your personal computer or your laptop?
</p>

<p>
If you want to find out, consider reading <a href="http://www.homac.de/files/EnergyStar/PowerMeasurements.pdf">Measuring Power Consumption in
the Light of EnergyStar</a>. It contains a detailed guide about how to test
your laptop for Energy Star compliance. At SUSE's <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Mobile_Devices_Team">Mobile Devices Team</a>,
we're currently building up a database of all different kind of laptop
computers regarding their Energy Star compliance and power
consumption. Wanna help? Follow the above mentioned guide and send your
results to me (hmacht a t suse d o t de). All results will help us to
drive development efforts in this area and will help to identify
possible power consumption regressions in upcoming releases. However, to
make this possible, the first thing we need is a base collection of
laptop results to compare against.
</p>

<p>
To prevent questions about publishing the results, no, I won't do
that. I do not want to compromise any kind of manufacturer in
public. They will notice for themselves as soon as there pop up more
laptops running Linux having a shiny blue Energy Star label printed on
the case or packing ;-)

After almost 2 years of QNotify hacking abstinence, I finally managed to

blew my machine with 100% CPU usage from time to time. Now the qnotify
command line client manages multiple notification widget on the desktop
on its own, by using a simple file locking mechanism. The outcome is
qnotify-0.6. Again, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=116172&package_id=126131&release_id=573987">Sourceforge</a> is your friend. For a really cool video

On a related note, does KDE4 actually have a companion piece to GNOME's

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-18">
<script type="text/javascript">  var disqus_url = "http://blog.homac.de/?p=58"; </script>

<p>
Finally I ordered a <a href="http://www.nokia.com/N810">Nokia N810</a> with my discount code provided by the
<a href="http://www.maemo.org">Maemo</a> project on Tuesday. It arrived Thursday. With all my tenseness and
pleasant anticipation, it looked and felt great while having a quick
glance. But the disenchantment followed right away:
</p>

<p>
Huh? What's that? It doesn't power on after shutting it down the first
time. Putting in the charger doesn't help. Removing the battery and
putting it back doesn't help. "Charging" it several hours (without any
sign that it does so) doesn't help. Removing the battery for several
minutes doesn't help. Checking with a original Nokia battery and charger
from a colleague doesn't help. What to do? (Already really frightened of
having received a broken device&#x2026;)
</p>

<p>
In the evening, I decided to remove the battery and put it on the
balcony. On the balcony? Why that? It only was a very vague
suspicion&#x2026;it's currently winter in Europe, you know
;-). Waiting&#x2026;(and maybe praying) about another 30 minutes. Device was
cold now. Inserting the battery, pushing the power button, and voila!
The N810 turns on and powers up properly. Happy about thinking that this
was only a temporary failure, I tried again some minutes later and the
device kept silent again. What a mess! Next day, another colleague came
to me telling me that he has exactly the same problem. And I already had
a temporary solution for him&#x2026;(Skip the next paragraph if you want to
read it immediately)
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a>'ing around, I found out that this is a well known problem, at
least for the customers, I don't know how it behaves to the Nokia
company/manufacturers. There are plenty of reports for this issue. On
<a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/">Internettablettalk</a> and even in the <a href="https://bugs.maemo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2673"> Maemo bugzilla</a> known as "N800 Power
up Drama". Interestingly, the problem seems to also be present on N800
devices. But only the new and recent ones. So it seems that some
electronic parts like capacitors installed in recent devices (N800 and
N810) are causing this issue. I tried everything people are suggesting,
waiting a specific period of time before switching it on again, making
sure that everything fits properly, enabling r&amp;d mode, and so on. Please
don't tell me "Just don't power off the device", because that's what I'm
generally doing, but that's no choice when you're on the road running
out of battery. And you sometimes need to power down the device for
development, too.
</p>

<p>
The only thing that seems to help:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Switch the device off
</li>
<li>Remove the battery
</li>
<li>Put the device to a fridge (without the battery) for about 30
minutes. If you are impatient like I am, put it into a deep-freezer
for about 10 minutes to get it cold. Hint: Use a plastic bag to
protect it from moisture, and more importantly, don't forget about
it while doing something else ;-)
</li>
<li>Take it out and insert the battery
</li>
<li>Turn it back on, you'll see that it works
</li>
</ol>

<p>
This procedure was already verified on two devices.
</p>

<p>
Strange, I currently know of five people having a <a href="http://www.nokia.com/N810">N810</a>, with two of them
showing this issue. This is really bad percentage. I already fear that
this is like the issue I encountered with my N800 and the display issue
where the right side of the touchscreen became more and more
unresponsive. Also widely known. To that time, I returned the <a href="http://www.nokia.com/N800">N800</a> back
to Nokia, and it lasted solid 6 weeks until I got a repaired device. I
do not want to repeat that! I do not want to develop inside a scratchbox
without the possibility to see the outcome on a live device. But the
most frustrating thing I encounter these days is that there is no
official statement from Nokia about this issue. There's still not even
one for the display issue with the N800. Please correct me if I'm wrong.
</p>

<p>
The only thing which keeps me alive ( ;-) ) and which prevents me from
returning the device immediately is the hope that it can be fixed via
software. I just hope that there will be a statement by the <a href="http://www.nokia.com">Nokia</a> or
<a href="http://www.maemo.org">Maemo</a> people telling me: "Be patient, we're working on the issue with
high pressure and we think it can be fixed with a firmware update". If
it really is a hardware issue, I at least hope that the issue is handled
as "we've sold broken devices, process returned ones with high
priority!".
</p>

<p>
Getting away from the bad news, if there wouldn't be those, I would
really be amazed by this gadget! As long as it's on, I just have fun
with it. I'm just very frustrated.

<h2 id="sec-21">The Ugliness of Suspend</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-21">
<script type="text/javascript">  var disqus_url = "http://blog.homac.de/?p=53"; </script>

<p>
These days, you can do absolutely all kinds of freaky stuff with your
Linux box. There are nearly no limitations for doing fancy graphics,
applications, 3D desktops etc.
</p>

<p>
However, there are still some rough edges which makes Linux still look
like a hacky system to new, or M$ blended,
users. Suspend. Hibernate. Standby. Whatever you might call them.  No!
You never ever want to see a white font on a black background with
cryptic statements when using a computer. You're writing letters, you're
browsing the web, you're sending emails, you're editing pictures, and
once in a while, you like you're system to suspend to disk. And you
don't want to see all this ugliness in front of you!
</p>

<p>
Luckily, times are changing. So with the release of openSUSE Beta1,
you'll not see this ugliness again. With the integration of <a href="http://splashy.alioth.debian.org">splashy</a>,
you'll always see a nice image showing you the progress of suspend and
resume. The general aim is to <b>hide</b> all the ugliness on your system
from you. That doesn't mean removing it. I'm using the ugliness all day
long on my own ;-)
</p>

<p>
Configuring splashy is easy. Most important files atm:
</p>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>/etc/splashy/config.xml: General configuration, which theme to use,
etc. 'man splashy-config.xml' for more information
</li>
<li>/etc/splashy/themes/default/theme.xml: Theme configuration, where
are the images, fade, progressbar, text, etc., 'man
splashy-theme.xml' for more information
</li>
<li>/etc/splashy/themes/default/suspend.png: Image used for
suspending. You put there any image you like. Run 'mkinitrd'
afterwards to enable it also for resume
</li>
</ul>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://www.homac.de/files/suspend_small.png" alt="suspend_small.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
I'm currently using a somehow experimental approach for the suspend
image. I'm taking a screenshot of the currently displayed desktop,
blurring and black&amp;whitening it with convert, and using it to show the
progress bar afterwards. This may take up to two seconds on a moderate
system. It's a cool feature, however, if the impact on the suspend time
is too high, I might consider removing it again. Please share any
experience you may make. Let's test this together in Beta1!
</p>

<p>
Currently the screenshot creation and image manipulation is done by a
pm-utils hook. It would be better to let kpowersave/gnome-power-manager
take the screenshot and put it to a place splashy can read from. This
way it would be possible to configure the shown image inside kcontrol or
the gnome-control-center. And that's actually what you want. There just
wasn't enough time yet to implement this correctly.
</p>

<p>
So what about Suspend to RAM? I'll see what I can do. One might think
that it doesn't make much sense there because S2RAM is so fast
anyway. However, it's still not fast enough ;-) You can still read
"Preparing suspend&#x2026;" for the time of a wink of your eyes. And I've set
myself the goal to iron this out ;-)
</p>

<p>
Actually, splashy is already in Alpha7, but you have to enable it there
first. So if you're too impatient for waiting for Beta1, enter 'splash =
y' in /etc/suspend.conf to get it. This is due to a
<a href="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=293826">bug</a> which
prevented to abort the suspend I had to fix first.
</p>

<p>
The old <a href="http://www.bootsplash.org/Welcome_to_the_graphical_world_of_Linux">bootsplash</a> is still used for
general boot and shutdown, though. We'll see what we can do to have a
smooth conversion in the future.
</p>

<p>
As always, if you find issues, put them into
<a href="http://bugzilla.novell.com">bugzilla</a>.  <b>Hint:</b> Enter 'splash = n' in
/etc/suspend.conf to disable splash for debugging of general suspend
problems. But those are non existant anyway ;-)
</p>

<p>
Have fun, Holger

<h2 id="sec-23">GTK status icon mess</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-23">
<p>
While trying to add the ability to change the display brightness via the
tray icon in gnome-power-manager, I just wanted to catch the
corresponding mouse wheel events on a GtkStatusIcon. Seeing that this is
not possible without ugly hacks or whole reimplementations is really
bad. It would really be simple to add this feature or to export the
underlying GtkWidget through the API so that one can catch he
'scroll-event' manually. Looking for the causes, found <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=409435">that</a>. Why is
working on GNOME or GTK sometimes so depressive&#x2026;

<h2 id="sec-24">org.freedesktop.PowerManagement</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-24">
<p>
There's currently a <a href="http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xdg/2007-March/009489.html">discussion on the xdg@freedesktop.org list</a> started
by <a href="http://hughsient.livejournal.com/">Richard Hughes</a> about a common org.freedesktop.PowerManagement
interface <a href="http://people.freedesktop.org/~hughsient/temp/power_management-spec-0.1.html">(first draft available)</a> which will hopefully become cross
desktop. Currently it includes methods like:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>org.freedesktop.PowerManagement.Shutdown()
</li>
<li>org.freedesktop.PowerManagement.Reboot()
</li>
<li>org.freedesktop.PowerManagement.Suspend()
</li>
<li>org.freedesktop.PowerManagement.Suspend()
</li>
<li>org.freedesktop.PowerManagement.GetOnBattery()
</li>
<li>&#x2026;
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Well, this all sounds very good, no? Of course it does, and it is!
There's already a lot agreemennt on the most of those methods from both
sides, KDE and GNOME which is really great.
</p>

<p>
But there's one problem I'm currently seeing. In my opinion, it would be
better to define two methods Shutdown() and Reboot() somewhere in the
desktop base (something like org.freedesktop.Desktop) in the future
(KDE4, GNOME 3.0, etc&#x2026;). I indeed think that they are in the scope of
power management, but still have some kind of exceptional
position. Having them tied to the o.f.PM interface, and more important,
the methods being compulsory, would force the desktop to always
implement all methods of the interface. Do you get the idea?
</p>

<p>
So if you don't have a power management application such as kpowersave
or gnome-power-manager the desktop itself would have to implement all
the other methods like Suspend() or Hibernate(), which seems strange to
me, especially in regard to usual desktop systems. You sometimes just
don't need them. To rephrase it a little bit, some people might just not
want them for whatever reasons. Having the Shutdown() and Reboot()
methods methods compulsory will make it very hard to split them out in
future.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, in current implementations, both kpowersave and gnome power
manager just call the logout mechanism of "their" desktop, which
involved saving the session etc. Applications could just call the logout
mechanisms themselves instead of handing them over to a interface which
then again hands them over to someone else, no?
</p>

<p>
Currently gnome-power-manager is very well integrated into GNOME. For
instance, if there's not battery or other laptop specific capabilities,
the icon just disappears. So one could argue that g-p-m is a direct part
of the desktop base. Not so for KDE. KDE currently doesn't have a clever
power management application by default. However, I really like to see
kpowersave in KDE default in the near future, but that's another story.
</p>

<p>
Ideally, IMHO, it should look as follows in the future:
</p>

<p>
Having a base interface org.freedesktop.Desktop which carries out
methods like Shutdown(), Reboot(), Logout() or Session.Save(). And on
top of it there should be something like
org.freedesktop.Desktop.PowerManagement.Suspend() and the like:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>org.freedesktop.Desktop
</li>
<li>org.freedesktop.Desktop.Shutdown()
</li>
<li>org.freedesktop.Desktop.Reboot()
</li>
<li>org.freedesktop.Desktop.Session.Save()
</li>
<li>org.freedesktop.Desktop.PowerManagement.Suspend()
</li>
<li>org.freedesktop.Desktop.PowerManagement.GetOnBattery()
</li>
</ul>

<p>
One could of course just let the word "Desktop" slip, that's an
implementation detail.
</p>

<p>
The first four methods get served by the desktop base, the last two by a
power management application if one available.
</p>

<p>
It seems that this proposal already got some agreement from a some
people both from the KDE and GNOME community. Intefaces might be called
org.freedesktop.SessionManagement.Shutdown() (same for Reboot()) and
org.freedesktop.PowerManagement.*. But that is still to be defined.
</p>

<p>
Comments and opinions would be welcome!

FOSDEM was great. Attended some interesting talks like one about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE4">KDE4</a>,
Andrew Morton talking about <a href="http://archive.fosdem.org/2007/schedule/events/linux_kernel">trends in linux kernel development</a>, <a href="http://ohm.freedesktop.org">Open
Hardware Manager</a> and of course a lot of <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/FOSDEM2007">openSUSE</a> talks. Like the one
from <a href="http://blog.nouse.net">Timo</a> about <a href="http://thinkfinger.sourceforge.net">libthinkfinger</a> or the one from <a href="http://blog.cryptomilch.de">Daniel</a> about <a href="http://www.opensync.org">opensync</a>.
</p>

<p>
But more important are the people you meet. Hacking the whole year,
writing and answering mails or chatting, and you actually never know to
whom you are talking. It is hard enough to know what you are talking
about ;-)
</p>

<p>
Well, and I discovered some really nice feature on the n800 called <a href="http://maemo.org/maemowiki/ApplicationManagerRedPillMode">red
pill mode</a>. Usually the application manager does not show you all the
library and system packages and does not offer many features for
advanced users. But with turning on red pill mode, you get them
all. Turning on blue pill mode makes them go away again. This would
actually be a great idea for the two biggest desktops. GNOME has too
less options, KDE too many. With a system like this, you would solve the
main issue both desktops have IMHO.

<h3 id="sec-26-1">Maemo Music Player Client</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-26-1">
<p>
As briefly mentioned last time, I got a developer code for a <a href="http://www.nokia.com/n800">Nokia
n800</a>. Thanks. I already had a n770, so without further ado, I decided to
purchase one. And that really kept me on the go the last couple of
weeks. At home, my computer is connected to my stereo system to play my
mp3s with passable good sound. So having a n800 with wlan, I thought
there has to be a possibility to use it as remote control. Looking for
something at the web, I shortly found the <a href="http://www.musicpd.org">Music Player Daemon (mpd)</a> to
be used as a service running on my home computer managing and playing my
mp3 collection. And very easy to install. Well, first duty was to find a
good client that works on the n800. Trying two web based clients and
noticing that they are ugly was not really satisfying. It was not hard
to build the <a href="http://www.musicpd.org/gmpc.shtml">Gnome Music Player Client</a> with some small modifications
inside my scratchbox environment for the <a href="http://www.maemo.org">Maemo</a> platform. Too bad for me,
the GUI is optimised for higher screen resolutions and for multi
windowed systems.
</p>

<p>
The default multimedia player which comes along with the n800 is quite
nice IMO, so an interface similar to this would be best. Well, noticing
that Nokia didn't open source its code although there's a request from
within the community is quite disappointing. I thought they wouldn't do
things by halves, but, well, other story&#x2026; Hopefully there's at least
no patent or the like for the GUI, otherwise I just hope they won't sue
me for reverse engineering it ;-)
</p>

<p>
Writing my first own gtk application was quite exhausting. The
documentation is so horrible bad :-( I just wonder why there aren't more
tutorials out there. For instance, about IMHO common problems like
setting bold font of a row in a GtkTreeView. Well, after getting into
it, it was, hm, well, O.k. ;-)
</p>

<p>
So here it is:
</p>

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://mmpc.garage.maemo.org/images/playing_1.png" alt="playing_1.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
It is based on the <a href="http://sarine.nl/gmpc">Gnome Music Player Client</a>, but has undergone quite
much modification like hildonization, Maemo menus, the new player
interface, etc&#x2026; The GUI got especially designed to be used as a remote
control, meaning that it should be good to use without the stylus. All
in all, it is more a fork than a port. The first couple of days really
show the huge interest in an application like this. At the time of
writing this, there are already 281 downloads as you can see on the
Maemo garage <a href="https://garage.maemo.org/frs/?group_id=193"> project page</a>. It's a great toy ;-)
</p>

<p>
Actually I had another cool feature in mind. The device being used as a
remote control, and only as a remote control, you do not want other
people using or seeing any other things on the device while managing
music. So I actually wanted to force fullscreen mode until a correct
password gets entered. The code is already finished, but there's one
problem. The actual user can just turn off the device and reboot ;-) So
anyone having any idea how to prevent the user to reboot the device?
There's no possibility to lock the device in a way that one has to enter
a password everytime the device boots. Something like a PIN in cell
phones would be good. I can catch the hardware button event, of course,
but the system is turned off in any case. Different story&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
What I'm currently looking for is a graphic designer. I'm usually not
very good at that. So someone out there either doing web design or is
willing and able to design some nice play, stop, forward, backward,
etc. buttons? Any help would be appreciated. In any case, visit the
<a href="http://mmpc.garage.maemo.org">homepage</a> for more information.

<p>
Long time no post, and a lot of things happened. At least to me. Forgot
to mention last time, for anyone interested, I started college at the
<a href="http://www.uni-erlangen.org/">Friedrich-Alexander-University of Erlangen-Nuremberg</a> in middle of
october with course of studies in computer science. On Friday, the
winter semester was over - finally. Learning all this difficult and
completely new stuff is quite different from what I've been doing the
last couple of years at SUSE. So I was really busy the last months to
reconcile university and my work on linux ;-)
</p>

<p>
Well, but my time at SUSE isn't over, of course, still working there at
regular times, just not that much like before. And therefore, I wasn't
able to be as active in regard to linux as I hoped to be. You can't be
very innovative, you just have to do the things that have to be
done. Working on bugs, handling mail, etc.. I'll have two exams in
middle of March, though, but except from that, until the new semester
starts, I will be able to work fulltime on linux.
</p>

<h3 id="sec-27-2">openSUSE 10.2 and Dockutils</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-27-2">
<p>
Nevertheless, openSUSE 10.2 was released during this time, and I finally
finished the power management redesign <a href="http://forge.novell.com/pipermail/powersave-devel/2006-June/000589.html">announced</a> some time ago. Doing
stuff like integrating pm-utils, the CPUFreq HAL addon, adjusting the
powersave daemon or failing to get more involved in kpowersave's future
development.
</p>

<p>
Not to forget about <a href="http://dockutils.sourceforge.net">dockutils</a>, a framework, or better, a collection of
scripts providing an infrastructure to easily trigger actions on
docking/undocking requests for different laptops and vendors. To quote
the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Dockutils">openSUSE wiki page</a> where you can find more information, it shall be
the following, not more and not less:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Provide infrastructure to do userspace stuff that has to be done on
dock and undock
</li>
<li>Provide easy to use infrastructure for hardware vendors,
distributors or users to get proper docking station support or to do
just anything they like on dock/undock, for instance starting a
special tool or just displaying a message on the desktop.
</li>
<li>Provide infrastructure for nasty and ugly workarounds either because
of broken hardware, bugs or just because of a lack of support in the
kernel
</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are some basic scripts already included, at least to get the X60
dock station and some other Thinkpads working, but there's also still
lot to do. Some days ago I registered <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dockutils/">a project</a> at sourceforge. I'm not
even sure if dockutils prevails itself, but I needed a place to host the
code, and I did not want to just include it in the openSUSE rpms. So if
you like to have a look at it, check it out:
</p>


<p>
svn co <a href="https://dockutils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/dockutils">https://dockutils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/dockutils</a> dockutils
</p>


<p>
Just to prevent questions: Yes, I know that there is a new generic dock
station driver (and bay driver) in recent kernels, and yes, I already
got familiar with it, and yes, I will do the integration into HAL and
openSUSE very soon ;-)
</p>

<p>
Unfortunatelly, we get rare feedback on docking. Therefore I like to ask
some questions:
</p>

<p>
Do you have a docking station? Does it work for you? Does it work
combined with suspend/resume? Does the hardware included in the dock
station work after docking/undocking? Do you have a workaround or a
script to get it working? Please drop a comment, send me a mail or
create a bugreport if you can answer any of the above
questions. Otherwise it will be nearly impossible to improve docking
station support. You can find my email at the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Dockutils#How_to_contribute">openSUSE</a>. Thanks.
</p>

<p>
Next post will follow very soon, because I will have to write something
very exciting (at least to me) regarding the Nokia n800 I received a
developer code for, thanks Nokia!

<h2 id="sec-28">Liblazy - D-Bus methods provided for convenience</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-28">
<p>
I finally found some time to release <a href="http://liblazy.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software_2fliblazy">liblazy</a> to the public. I'm already
using it in several smaller applications and the KDE kickoff menu links
against it in openSUSE 10.2, so it's some kind of public, but there
hasn't been a place where you can download tarballs or to get further
information. Starting from today, it is hosted on <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org">freedesktop</a> and has a
<a href="http://liblazy.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software_2fliblazy">wiki page</a>.
</p>

<p>
So what's liblazy all about? Liblazy is a simple and easy to use library
that provides convenient functions for sending messages over the D-Bus
daemon, querying information from HAL or asking PolicyKit for a
privilege. Its features may grow as needed, though.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-28-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-28-1">Rationale</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-28-1">
<p>
Once in a while, I stumble across an application which has no proper
D-Bus support and gathers some information through reading /proc or
sysfs, or any other circumstantial way, although software like HAL or
PolicyKit already have this information. Or they just want to send a
simple message to another application, sometimes even without caring
about the reply. These applications often only have to do very simple
tasks.
</p>

<p>
So to adopt these applications, you always have to duplicate lots of
code over and over again.
</p>

<p>
Just some examples&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
To to send a message over D-Bus one has to do:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Get a D-Bus connection
</li>
<li>Check for errors
</li>
<li>Send a message over the bus
</li>
<li>Check for errors
</li>
<li>Get the reply
</li>
<li>Check for errors
</li>
</ol>

<p>
To get a simple property from HAL, one has to do (with libhal in this
example):
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Get a D-Bus connection
</li>
<li>Check for errors
</li>
<li>Get a LibHalContext
</li>
<li>C.f.e.
</li>
<li>Register the connection with the context
</li>
<li>C.f.e.
</li>
<li>Fetch the property with libhal
</li>
<li>C.f.e
</li>
</ol>

<p>
When you have to check if your application possess a specific privilege
according to PolicyKit:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Either do a mixture of the above things to ask directly via D-Bus or
link against libpolkit and do a complicated call of
libpolkit<sub>is</sub><sub>uid</sub><sub>allowed</sub><sub>for</sub><sub>privilege</sub>(7 arguments follow). This
call gives you a lot of information you might not care about at all.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
So in every application, you have to implement functions like:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>dbus<sub>send</sub><sub>message</sub>(service, path, interface, method);
</li>
<li>dbus<sub>send</sub><sub>message</sub><sub>with</sub><sub>reply</sub>(service, path, interface, method,
&amp;reply);
</li>

There are a lot of applications which just don't want to care too much
about D-Bus or HAL at all. I'm mostly talking about small applications,
of course, even about those without a mainloop. They just want to make
use of hardware databases and abstractions and a new way of inter
process communication we have with D-Bus these days.
</p>

<p>
So what I've done is combining these very simple functions into one
small library called liblazy. A small application may just want to do
the following to send a message over the bus and get its reply, maybe
even with ignoring any errors:
</p>


<p>
DBusMessage *reply;
liblazy<sub>dbus</sub><sub>system</sub><sub>send</sub><sub>method</sub><sub>call</sub>("org.freedesktop.NetworkworkManager",
"/org/freedesktop/NetworkManager",
"org.freedesktop.NetworkManager", "sleep", &amp;reply,
DBUS<sub>TYPE</sub><sub>INVALID</sub>);
</p>

<p>
int *arg<sub>from</sub><sub>reply</sub>; liblazy<sub>dbus</sub><sub>message</sub><sub>get</sub><sub>arg</sub>(reply,
DBUS<sub>TYPE</sub><sub>INT32</sub>, &amp;arg<sub>from</sub><sub>reply</sub>, 0);
</p>


<p>
That's it. The application developer just has to link against libdbus
and liblazy, without caring about any other stuff.
</p>

<p>
Liblazy also contains very simple functions to get a property from HAL
or ask for a privilege from PolicyKit. But it doesn't contain complex
functionality. It may grow as needed, though. But&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
It is definitely not intended for replacing any of the dbus bindings,
libhal or libpolkit. Complex applications can and will still have their
own implementations and will link agains libhal or libpolkit or
whatever. They are free to use liblazy, of course. But it is definitely
of benefit for small applications which only need a subset of
functionality and like to profit from new software like D-Bus, HAL,
etc. but without having to care a lot. It should serve as a set of
functions for developers provided for convenience. Also a lot more
command line applications could make use of HAL, etc. in an easy way
IMO. Additionally, it may serve as a code example for developers to get
familiar with D-Bus.

Most likely, my next blog post will contain something about dockutils, a
framework for getting docking station support for as many notebooks as
possible. But read more next time&#x2026;

<h2 id="sec-32">CPU frequency scaling in HAL</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-32">
<p>
Yesterday, my HAL addon which cares about CPU frequency scaling got
committed to the HAL git master branch. Finally, after one and a half
month of discussions, new patches, and no responses.
</p>

<p>
It's main goal is to unify the way linux distributions are doing CPU
frequency scaling. At the moment there are different daemons out there
which are doing the job. powernowd, cpuspeed or powersaved. Powersaved
currently is the only one which supports both kernel governors
(powersave, performance and ondemand) and has a userspace governor
implementation. All this is wrapped around by a nice DBus interface to
make it easy controllable by higher level applications like desktop GUIs
(e.g. kpowersave).
</p>

<p>
But unfortunately powersaved didn't get enough acceptance in the
community, for whatever reasons. And my main goal is to improve power
management in linux. So the only solution which seemed to be accepted by
the GNOME, the KDE and the general community was to put CPU frequency
scaling functionality into <a href="http://hal.freedesktop.org">HAL</a>.
</p>

<p>
In the end, this was no bad idea. This decision forced me reconsider
some parts of the present implementation and design which we have in
powersaved. And I really had a great idea. Maybe the best idea I ever
had. It's a real masterpiece ;-)
</p>

<p>
So in future, it comes along with most modern distributions. And
hopefully everybody will use it ;-) At least the gnome power manager
maintainer already states his willingness to make use of it in his
<a href="http://hughsient.livejournal.com/3265.html">blog</a>.
</p>

<p>
The following explanations should be the documentation for the CPUFreq
addon. It summarizes what has been discussed on the HAL and
powersave-devel mailinglist during the last weeks and what's the addon
all about. It should point out answers to the common questions which may
come up. If anything else is not clear, please don't hesitate to send me
an email or add a comment.

<h3 id="sec-32-1">Available methods on the interface org.freedesktop.Hal.Device.CPUFreq.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-32-1">
<p>
Method: SetCPUFreqGovernor (string)
</p>

<p>
Parameters: The name of the governor to set. Get a list of available
governors with the GetCPUFreqAvailableGovernors method.
</p>

<p>
Sets a CPU frequency scaling governor for all CPUFreq interfaces the
kernel provides. If the userspace governor is set, this interface also
contains a proper scaling mechanism. The default performance is set to
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li></li>
</ol>

<p>
Method: SetCPUFreqPerformance (integer)
</p>

<p>
Parameters: The performance between 1 and 100 to set in dynamic scaling
modes.
</p>

<p>
Sets the performance of the dynamic scaling mechanism. This method
summarizes and abstracts all the different settings which can be taken
for dynamic frequency adjustments, like at which load to switch up
frequency or how many steps the mechanism should traverse until reaching
the maximum frequency. The higher the value, the more performance you
get. Respectively, the higher the value, the sooner and the more often
the frequency is switched up.
</p>

<p>
Method: SetCPUFreqConsiderNice (boolean)
</p>

<p>
Parameters: Whether or not niced processes should be considered on CPU
load calculation.
</p>

<p>
Whether or not niced processes should be considered on CPU load
calculation. If niced processes are considered, they can cause a
frequency increment although their absolute load percentage wouldn't
trigger the scaling mechanism to switch up the frequency. The default
setting is 'false'.
</p>

<p>
Method: GetCPUFreqGovernor (void)
</p>

<p>
Get the current active governor for all CPU frequency interfaces
(string).
</p>

<p>
Method: GetCPUFreqPerformance (void)
</p>

<p>
Get the current active performance setting if a dynamic scaling
mechanism is in use (integer between 1 and 100).
</p>

<p>
Method: GetCPUFreqConsiderNice (void)
</p>

<p>
Returns whether niced processed are considered during CPU load
calculation or not (returns boolean).
</p>

<p>
Method: GetCPUFreqAvailableGovernors (void)
</p>

<p>
Returns a list of strings of all available governors which could be set
with the SetCPUFreqGovernor method.

<h3 id="sec-32-3">What's the CPUFreq addon all about</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-32-3">
<p>
Addon-cpufreq supports kernel governors and also implements a userspace
controlling mechanism. That makes it the "all you need for CPUFreq"
application. Furthermore, to not make things unnecessarily complicated
for desktop applications, it is supposed to abstract all the different
settings you can make for the different governors. One thing which isn't
available yet, is the possibility to control the performance of
dynamically scaled CPUs. There's a method to set the performance (from 1
to 100) which can be easily used from other applications with showing a
nice progress bar or the like. That makes it unique in contrast to
former solutions.
</p>

<p>
The biggest advantage is that you get CPUFreq out of the box on every
system supporting HAL without the need to install another
daemon. Another one is that desktop applications like
gnome-power-manager or kpowersave can use one common interface after
all.
</p>

<p>
In general, there are three different policies one can choose from:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Statically min frequency (corresponds to the powersave governor)
</li>
<li>Statically max frequency (corresponds to the performance governor)
</li>
<li>Dynamic frequency (ondemand or userspace governor)
</li>
</ol>

<p>
In an ideal world, the the first two shouldn't be used at all. But at
least the performance governor is still used because you get a little
bit more performance in comparison with the dynamic policy. Particularly
as soon as you have many small processes running. The default dynamic
setting can be and was sufficient in most cases. But it's a too general
setting IMO. So to basically get rid of the two static policies, I'm
doing a split of the dynmaic policy into several parts.
</p>

<p>
The dynamic machanisms, either ondemand governor, conservative governor
or the userspace implementation etc. consist each of several different
settings and configuration options like at which load to switch up, how
many steps the mechanism should traverse until reaching max freq and so
on. The SetCPUFreqPerformance method which is available combines all
these setting into one. The performance can be set between 1 and 100.
</p>

<p>
In general it sais, the higher the value the more often and the faster
the frequency is switched up. Each governor has some sort of fixed CPU
load limit (up<sub>threshold</sub>) at which load to switch up frequencies. For
instance, the ondemand governor has the up<sub>threshold</sub> set to 80 by
default. This corresponds to a performance value of 50. As an example,
if you change the performance to 75, the up<sub>threshold</sub> is set to
about 45. So if the CPU load reaches a value higher than 45, the
frequency is switched up. If the up<sub>threshold</sub> would be 80 and a process
would only need 60 percent of CPU, the frequency wouldn't be switched
up. If the performance value would be 1 (lowest performance), the
up<sub>threshold</sub> would be 99. That means that the frequency is really only
increased if you have a process which needs all CPU power (100%, for
instance at compilation time).
</p>

<p>
I will do a small comparison&#x2026; Two main situations where policies
differ are
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>On AC power: You want to do dynamic frequency scaling, but It's not
that important to reduce power consumption. You want to have the
maximum performance as soon as you start a process but still want to
reduce the power drain as soon as the system is idle. (e.g. because
of thermal reasons). So you need a more aggressive dynamic CPU
frequency scaling where you switch up sooner and more often. So for
instance, you set the performance to 75.
</li>
<li>On battery: The primary goal is to increase battery life. But you
still want a job done as fast as possible as soon there is need to,
for instance when compiling. So you might want a more tentative
frequency adjustment. Performance maybe set to 25 in this case.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The reason why I chose such a fine grained range (from 1 to 100) is to
get an interface that is not limited to only one implementation. For the
CPUFreq case, one can image to have only five steps like min, low,
medium, high, max. But that's something the GUI can and should
decide. It can map these 100 steps to whatever it likes but I don't
think that's the job of the addon. And maybe some system (embedded?,
whatever) likes to have a completely other implementation with 20, 30,
or even 100 steps but still likes to take advantage of the common
interface, it than wouldn't be limited to a predefined range.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, if a policy decision maker (like a GUI) doesn't like to
touch the performance setting, it doesn't need to. It gets a good
default setting. The default is 50 and corresponds to a configuration
which is either the kernel default or which is tested to be stable and
useful for several years now in the userspace case.

<h3 id="sec-32-4">FAQ</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-32-4">
<p>
<b>Q:</b> What's the SetCPUFreqConsiderNice setting all about?
</p>

<p>
<b>A:</b> With the ondemand governor this setting is set through
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/ondemand/ignore<sub>nice</sub><sub>load</sub> . The
userspace implementation evaluates the CPU nice load when calculation
the CPU load, too.  It specifies whether niced processes can cause a CPU
frequency increment although they don't really need that much CPU power
and thus wouldn't jump over the UP<sub>THRESHOLD</sub> where frequencies are
usually increased.  It's a policy decision. On AC power for example, you
also want to consider niced processes because switching up CPU
frequencies more often isn't that problematic. In the other case, On
battery, you want a more passive frequency policy and thus you don't
consider niced processes.
</p>

<p>
<b>Q:</b> Why not export a D-Bus interface for each of the processors in the
system?
</p>

<p>
<b>A:</b> I thought about this possibility, too, but came to the conclusion
that it doesn't make sense. There main reasons are:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>There are several dependencies between the different CPUs. The
cpufreq interfaces below <i>sys/devices/system/cpu</i> lists all
available CPUs, each in one directory. However, you cannot assume
that you can simply control each CPU through it's single
interface. There's a file affected<sub>cpus</sub> in each directory listing
the CPUs which are controlled through this interface. So maybe it
could look like:
</li>
</ol>

It doesn't make sence to export these dependencies. This would make

<li>Some of the cpufreq kernel developers even are agains the

<li>There's a new powernow-k8 driver pending where you only can scale

<li>There's currently no such device object where to export it. There's

<p>
<b>A:</b> No. Usually I'm one of those arguing for having a possibility to
export all possible features to the user on the desktop ;-) But&#x2026;  This
doesn't really fit into the concept of this addon. It would be a method
that can only exclusively used if the userspace governor is set. And
that contradics the concept to use common interfaces for all
governors. And to be honest, we all hope that the userspace governor
wouldn't be needed anymore someday. However, it would be possible. It
would need another method SetCPUFreqFrequency and another property
'cpufreq<sub>available</sub><sub>frequencies</sub>'. But I really like to avoid that. This
would also be something which we could add afterwards if it turns out be
be <span class="underline">really</span> needed.

<script type="text/javascript">  var disqus_url = "http://blog.homac.de/?p=39"; </script>

<p>
About three weeks ago, something must have happened with my mind. KDE
became too boring, WindowMaker was already gone for some time and I
needed something new. Well, I always used GNOME applications before, I
really like the design and it's the business desktop number one, so I
gave it a try. And I don't mean something like starting it, clicking
around and leaving. This I've already done multiple times like when
testing the gnome-power-manager or other applications. I really ment to
try to get familiar with it and working with it on a daily basis. So I
opened my mind for something which is known as "the bad thing" among KDE
developers
</p>

<p>
After all, I decided to write down everything I would like or
dislike. And now, after 3 weeks of continuous GNOME usage, here are the
results. If anything is wrong, or maybe I just oversaw a gconf key,
please tell me.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-34-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-34-1">Window resizing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-34-1">
<p>
The most likely most popular example that also hit me is the not
existing possibility to resize windows with ALT-Right-Click. Well if you
are used to that behaviour, it's really hard to forget this
feature. Additionally, when working in a fast way, moving windows
around, resizing many of them, it's sometimes hard to catch the bottom
right area to bring up an arrow to finally change the size. After one
week or so, I got along with it and it wasn't that painful anymore
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-34-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-34-2">Workspace switching</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-34-2">
<p>
I'm used to a one dimensional workspace layout, four workspaces in a
row. And of course, after the last workspace I want to wrap around to
the first. Well, not possible with GNOME. There's already a detailed
bugreport about this issue but was rejected because it would confuse the
users. Oh what a mess. So I changed the layout to have two rows, each
one having two desktops.

<p>
There's no possibility to remove all icons from the desktop, two will
stay there whatever you do. Oh stop, I finally found a possibility,
killing the nautilus process. Unfortunatelly, my desktop wallpaper
disappears, but that's something I can cope with.
</p>

<p>
Thanks for the comments. It is possible to remove the icons,

too dumb to find it :-)

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-34-4">
<p>
If english is not your native language, like in my case, but you still
have to deal with bugreports, reproducing, confirming, etc., you like to
switch the language of the GUIs at runtime. Not possible. You have to
specify the language at login time. But that's one of the smaller
issues, it would just be "nice to have". Nevetheless, annoying.

<h3 id="sec-34-5">Bad session management for non-GNOME applications</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-34-5">
<p>
One might argue that you simply should use GNOME applications in this
case, but that's not the way I'm working. I use a mixture of all, GNOME,
KDE, QT, tcl applications and so on. Yes, you can't support all crappy
applications, but why isn't emacs recognized at all for example? Just
strange that KDE can handle this.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-34-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-34-6">The hidden monster</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-34-6">
<p>
Although it has a rather minimalistic style and design (What I really
like actually), it's as slow as KDE. Also the memory usage is as high as
with KDE. I just recall people telling me that C++ applications are a
performance loss&#x2026;
</p>

<h3 id="sec-34-7">Panel application starter</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-34-7">
<p>
When invoking the panel application starter with ALT-F2, I can't figure
out the system how applications are stored in the history. I would
expect that if I press the up-arrow-key, the previous executed
application would come up. There's lots of applications in the history,
but not the last or the second to the last. But I really can't say were
the application which come up do come from.
</p>

<p>
And again, this application is so fucking slow. Even on startup. After
typing a command, it seems to be that it has some sort of completion
mechanism and tries to find the corresponding icon for the application
typed. And this can last up to 3 seconds.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-34-8">
<p>
My favourite terminal is konsole. Actually I would use xterm if it
wouldn't lose it's focus sometimes when switching workspaces. So it's
some kind of comparison between konsole and the gnome-terminal. Because
if I'm using GNOME, I also want to use its utilities.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Not possible to scroll single lines with shift-up/down
</li>
<li>Not possible to store tabs in profiles
</li>
<li>Just a personal opinion, the tabs on top of the window really look
ugly ;-)
</li>
<li>Same problem like with workspaces, not possible to wrap around from
the last tab to the first one
</li>
<li>gnome-terminal seems to be incompatible with some key combinations
like ALT-. They are not working in the default configuration for zsh
and irssi. And I wasn't able to change this via the provided menus
like I can do for konsole.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
All in all, no, gnome-terminal is nothing for me if I like to do
productive working.

<h3 id="sec-34-10">Conclusion</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-34-10">
<p>
I really like the look and feel of gtk. It's simple but very nice. And I
really think that the GNOME desktop is better suited for business use or
for unexperienced users in contrast to KDE in its current state. In KDE
the user is striked daed by hundred of menus and settings which is
really confusing in the first place. Although I didn't elaborate these
two advantages much, they are very very strong.
</p>

<p>
I used and worked with it for 3 weeks now. I changed my personal working
behaviour and I really became inured to it. I can work with it now after
adopting to what this desktop (matacity, whatever) pretends. But I think
this is actually the problem. I simply don't want to adopt! That's not
how I see this open source thing these days. If a developer started with
GNOME and got used to it, he wouldn't ever notice that this desktop
doesn't do what he actually wants. He just fits his working behaviour
into the desktop guidelines. If that would be the way he works anyway,
then he's the lucky one. But for anyone else I can't understand how a
developer actually likes to use it. Yes, developing it, extending it,
making it better, but not using it. Everytime I have an idea how to
perfect the way I work a little bit more to get the best out of it, I'm
limited by the desktop. That's not satisfying. So the day before
yesterday, I switched back to KDE although I don't like the look and
feel that much. Fortunately, everybody can make this decision on his
own.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-35">

<p>
Looking for some nice modifications for my mutt in the web, I stumbled
over <a href="http://mutt-ng.berlios.de/">mutt-ng (mutt next generation)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Well, that it what I was looking for all the time. These are the reasons
why I favour mutt-ng over mutt&#x2026;
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I do not have to patch my mutt anymore to get a nice sidebar showing
all my folders. It highlights folders with new mail and I can see
which folders still have unread (not new) mails in them.
</li>
<li>Another big advantage is the possibility to read nntp news and to
treat them exactly like any other mails.
</li>
<li>Until now, everytime I reinstalled my system I had to configure my
local postfix to sent my mails (with tls). Muttng finally supports
the smtp protocol (with tls, of course). I agree that the separation
of a MUA like mutt and an MTA like postfix is generally a good idea,
but with the new integration of smtp, it makes my life a lot
easier. I just have to store my configuration in my home directory
and everytime I upgrade my system I just have to keep my home
partition and I can send mails without any further
adjustments. That's nice!
</li>
<li>According to the <a href="http://mutt-ng.berlios.de/">homepage</a> and the two mailinglists, there's heavy
(and happy ;-) development going on. So possible new features and
patches will hopefully go in sooner as it has been with mutt until
now.
</li>
<li>No problems and crashes so far
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I also decided to package it for the SUSE distribution. So it should
soon show up in the factory tree.
</p>

<p>
I have nicely separated my "old" mutt configuration from the new mutt-ng
configuration so I can switch back easily if something unexpected might
happen. I now have file ~/.muttngrc which sources my ~/.mutt/muttrc with
the following content:
</p>

<p>
` source ~/.mutt/muttrc # sidebar settings set sidebar<sub>visible</sub>=yes set
sidebar<sub>width</sub>=25 set sidebar<sub>shorten</sub><sub>hierarchy</sub>=yes set
sidebar<sub>number</sub><sub>format</sub>=%n(%u) color sidebar<sub>new</sub> brightyellow default #

The suspend and resume tools from the <i>suspend project</i> finally got

all, of course ;-) Currently only bootsplash.org's method is
supported. But I designed it to be as modular as possible to support any
kind of splash implementations. The next thing I like to look at is
fbsplash. But therefore I have to setup a gentoo system which will needs

So, what's new? The most important thing is definitely the support for
CPU hotplugging with full integration into our scheme architecture.
</p>

<p>
[Once again, I think we are the first application out there implementing
that state of the art feature and integrating it into an easy to use
architecture]
</p>

<p>
What about disabling one of two cores when running on batteries and
being at full throttle when on ac? I think this simply a great and
promising opportunity. Unfortunatelly, up to now only newer laptops
support it at all, but this will become more and more important in
future. Of course, this also works for desktop or server systems. So if
you are already in a position (like me ;-) to make use of it, try it and
provide feedback of any kind. Integration into kpowersave will be done
soon.
</p>

<p>
There's a new configuration variable that can be set in each scheme
controlling CPU hotplugging: From /etc/powersave/scheme<sub>powersave</sub>:
</p>

<p>
` ## Path: System/Powermanagement/Powersave/CPU ## Type:

<p>
Looking for a screen capturing software this evening, I finally found
vnc2swf which works quite well. I only tried the C version because I was
too lazy to solve all those python dependencies and I have no good rpm
repository at home. Just a short guide for anyone who wants to try:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Download vnc2swf from
<a href="http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/vnc2swf/vnc2swf.html">here</a>
</li>
<li>Compile and install it
</li>
<li>Start a vnc server like that: `vncserver :1 -geometry 640x480
</li>
</ol>
<p>
-depth 16`
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Execute the following command to start recording: `vnc2swf
</li>
</ol>
<p>
-startrecording -geometry 640:480 out.swf :1 &gt; out.html`
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Play the resulting html file in your favourite browser which
supports shockwave flash
</li>
</ol>

<p>
If you like to see how a possible result might look like, watch my <b>live
demonstration</b> about <a href="http://qnotify.homac.de">LibQNotify</a>. LibQNotify
is an very easy to use QT library to pop up information on the
desktop. There also comes along a command line tool and daemon. Have a
look at the <a href="http://qnotify.homac.de">project page</a> for more
information. The video is not perfect because the frame drops are too
high in some cases. So be sure that in reality everything is very smooth

There really happened much the last time, although the last post is
nearly one month ago. Sorry for that (if anyone is interested in what I
am writing at all ;-) The most time consuming was my trip to <a href="http://www.fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a> at
Brussels. I spent much time with the preparations of a talk I had
toghether with Timo Honig about Powermanagement. Slides are already
available at <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/FOSDEM">opensuse wiki</a>. Videos should also be uploaded soon. Hmm,
for me, having a talk in english for the first time, I am satisfied with
the result. We had a little break with technical problems in the middle
of the talk, but all in all, it was ok. I mean, for a kraut having a
talk in english the first time in his life, I did not expect more ;-)
But the even more important impressions were the people I met. I met
Fred Blaise (<a href="http://madpenguin.org/blogs/chapeaurouge/">blog</a>, yes, he has one, unlike Timo ;-) ). a friend of Timo
from France, aehm, the USA, Belgium or whatever ;-). I really hope to
meet him again some day, having a beer, or two, or three&#x2026; Dominic
Rath, also a friend of Timo gave a talk in the embedded devel room. I'm
still not sure what he was exactly talking about, but the other embedded
freaks listening seemed to be really impressed ;-) Back in Nurnberg, the
main thing I've done is maintaining the powersave daemon. And I mean
real maintenance. Not much development, only integrating patches,
branching, merging, releasing and so on. We have know support for
suspend2 and the socalled hibernate scripts out of the
box. Unfortunately, it seems too late to get the Powersave daemon as a
default powermanagement solution for the Ubuntu Dapper release. That
would really be great and I would like to help in any regard to make
this possible. But it's not my decision ;-) I'm also currently
evaluating multicore support for Powersave. Many of the newer laptops
are shipped with two cores already, and it will become even more
important in the future. So it would be great to have only one core
activated when running on battery and having full power when running on
ac. Hopefully I will find some time for integration into the Powersave
schemes soon. Finally, again promising that I will blog more regulary in
future, don't forget to have a lot of fun! Holger

We are really making progress with bringing the Powersave daemon into
the community. There are already about 15 subscribers on the powersave
devel list. Due to this increasing number, I set up a new mailinglist
powersave-users@forge.novell.com. There should be handled all kind of so
called 'user support'. Everything related to development should be
handled on powersave-devel. This announcement was made on several
mailing lists to reach as much interested people as possible. We (the
powersave team ;-)) invite everybody to take part in developing the
Powersave daemon. I'm really happy to see that we get more and more
feedback from other distributions like Fedora, KUbuntu or Debian. Let's
continue that way&#x2026; Additionally. I registered a channel #powersave at

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-48">
<script type="text/javascript">  var disqus_url = "http://blog.homac.de/?p=25"; </script>

<p>
I just wanted to play around with the bootsplash a little bit, but it
consts me several hours. At first, the documentation is completely
outdated, thus RTFM didn't help much. Someone knows more recent
documentation (not the READMEs, they are the same)? Please drop me a
note and I will slap the bootsplash.org webmaster for not pointing to it
;-) Google? Maybe I unlearned " to google" in the right way, but there
is not much either. Installing a new bootsplash is steight
forward. Simply copy a new theme below /etc/bootsplash/themes and
recreate your initrd to use it. Getting the "verbose splash" while the
system is up is also easy: ` splash
/etc/bootsplash/themes//config/bootsplash-.cfg ` But I nearly dispaired
of getting the "silent splash". When looking at several websites, the
splash utility is used in many different ways. At first it came to my
mind that the "splash -s" or "splash -S" could mean silent, but who
knows? No manpage, no "&#x2013;help" output. Sorry, but this piece of software
is a horror. I saw another one while digging around the web and maybe
should have used that one. Ok, back to getting into silent splash
mode. After looking at various rc scripts, I came across /etc/rc.splash
which finally had the solution. The SuSE bootsplash theme contains some
lines as follows: ` trigger silent play anim trigger "rlchange B" play
text system trigger "rlchange 3" play text devices trigger "rlchange 5"
play text devices trigger "rlreached 5" toverbose trigger "YaST running"
stopanim anim trigger "rlreached 0" tosilent ` Seems that this is
related to my aim. On action "rlchange 0" for example, goto silent mode
(tosilent). But how to trigger this trigger? Ahh, there is an option
'-t' to give to the splash binary. Everything I read said something
about "this is the text to display". That might be true if you have a
textbox in your bootsplash, and have defined triggers to change the
text, but this is generally speaking simply wrong. The option '-t' just
triggers specific actions and has nothing to do with text. No
documentation states that. Bullshit! So all you need to go to silent
mode is to do a ` splash -t "rlreached 0"
/etc/bootsplash/themes//config/bootsplash-.cfg ` provided that you have
a line like this in your config file: `trigger "rlreached 0" tosilent`
Wouldn't it be better to have something like this: `trigger "silent"
tosilent` A 'splash -t "silent"' would be more intuitive IMHO. But this
is personal taste. Last but not least, I have one more. Don't forget to
put a newline at the end of your config file, else you will wonder for a
long time why it doesn't work as expected although you thought that you
had understand this whole thing. As a conclusion, IMO I think all this
bootspash monster is a good example how software should not be done. At
least i learned that ;-) Happy splashing, Holger

Tested the new userland software suspend today with patched kernel

loaded the cpu to 99 %. Have to look at this further. Also I did not yet
test the resume functionality because the system also resumed with the
old in-kernel implementation wich should be 100% compatible. Have to
figure out how to start a binary from initrd first. I think I will
write, or only adjust, the userland tools needed. This way we will have
some nice bootsplash on suspend and resume. I think there will be
another release to test soon. Have fun, Holger
