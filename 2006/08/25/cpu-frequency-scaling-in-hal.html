<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
Yesterday, my HAL addon which cares about CPU frequency scaling got
committed to the HAL git master branch. Finally, after one and a half
month of discussions, new patches, and no responses.
</p>
<p>
It's main goal is to unify the way linux distributions are doing CPU
frequency scaling. At the moment there are different daemons out there
which are doing the job. powernowd, cpuspeed or powersaved. Powersaved
currently is the only one which supports both kernel governors
(powersave, performance and ondemand) and has a userspace governor
implementation. All this is wrapped around by a nice DBus interface to
make it easy controllable by higher level applications like desktop GUIs
(e.g. kpowersave).
</p>
<p>
But unfortunately powersaved didn't get enough acceptance in the
community, for whatever reasons. And my main goal is to improve power
management in linux. So the only solution which seemed to be accepted by
the GNOME, the KDE and the general community was to put CPU frequency
scaling functionality into <a href="http://hal.freedesktop.org">HAL</a>.
</p>
<p>
In the end, this was no bad idea. This decision forced me reconsider
some parts of the present implementation and design which we have in
powersaved. And I really had a great idea. Maybe the best idea I ever
had. It's a real masterpiece ;-)
</p>
<p>
So in future, it comes along with most modern distributions. And
hopefully everybody will use it ;-) At least the gnome power manager
maintainer already states his willingness to make use of it in his
<a href="http://hughsient.livejournal.com/3265.html">blog</a>.
</p>
<p>
The following explanations should be the documentation for the CPUFreq
addon. It summarizes what has been discussed on the HAL and
powersave-devel mailinglist during the last weeks and what's the addon
all about. It should point out answers to the common questions which may
come up. If anything else is not clear, please don't hesitate to send me
an email or add a comment.

<h3 id="sec-1-1">Available methods on the interface org.freedesktop.Hal.Device.CPUFreq.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">


<p>
Method: SetCPUFreqGovernor (string)
</p>
<p>
Parameters: The name of the governor to set. Get a list of available
governors with the GetCPUFreqAvailableGovernors method.
</p>
<p>
Sets a CPU frequency scaling governor for all CPUFreq interfaces the
kernel provides. If the userspace governor is set, this interface also
contains a proper scaling mechanism. The default performance is set to
</p><ol>
<li>
</li>
</ol>


<p>
Method: SetCPUFreqPerformance (integer)
</p>
<p>
Parameters: The performance between 1 and 100 to set in dynamic scaling
modes.
</p>
<p>
Sets the performance of the dynamic scaling mechanism. This method
summarizes and abstracts all the different settings which can be taken
for dynamic frequency adjustments, like at which load to switch up
frequency or how many steps the mechanism should traverse until reaching
the maximum frequency. The higher the value, the more performance you
get. Respectively, the higher the value, the sooner and the more often
the frequency is switched up.
</p>
<p>
Method: SetCPUFreqConsiderNice (boolean)
</p>
<p>
Parameters: Whether or not niced processes should be considered on CPU
load calculation.
</p>
<p>
Whether or not niced processes should be considered on CPU load
calculation. If niced processes are considered, they can cause a
frequency increment although their absolute load percentage wouldn't
trigger the scaling mechanism to switch up the frequency. The default
setting is 'false'.
</p>
<p>
Method: GetCPUFreqGovernor (void)
</p>
<p>
Get the current active governor for all CPU frequency interfaces
(string).
</p>
<p>
Method: GetCPUFreqPerformance (void)
</p>
<p>
Get the current active performance setting if a dynamic scaling
mechanism is in use (integer between 1 and 100).
</p>
<p>
Method: GetCPUFreqConsiderNice (void)
</p>
<p>
Returns whether niced processed are considered during CPU load
calculation or not (returns boolean).
</p>
<p>
Method: GetCPUFreqAvailableGovernors (void)
</p>
<p>
Returns a list of strings of all available governors which could be set
with the SetCPUFreqGovernor method.

<h3 id="sec-1-3">What's the CPUFreq addon all about</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">


<p>
Addon-cpufreq supports kernel governors and also implements a userspace
controlling mechanism. That makes it the "all you need for CPUFreq"
application. Furthermore, to not make things unnecessarily complicated
for desktop applications, it is supposed to abstract all the different
settings you can make for the different governors. One thing which isn't
available yet, is the possibility to control the performance of
dynamically scaled CPUs. There's a method to set the performance (from 1
to 100) which can be easily used from other applications with showing a
nice progress bar or the like. That makes it unique in contrast to
former solutions.
</p>
<p>
The biggest advantage is that you get CPUFreq out of the box on every
system supporting HAL without the need to install another
daemon. Another one is that desktop applications like
gnome-power-manager or kpowersave can use one common interface after
all.
</p>
<p>
In general, there are three different policies one can choose from:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Statically min frequency (corresponds to the powersave governor)
</li>
<li>Statically max frequency (corresponds to the performance governor)
</li>
<li>Dynamic frequency (ondemand or userspace governor)
</li>
</ol>


<p>
In an ideal world, the the first two shouldn't be used at all. But at
least the performance governor is still used because you get a little
bit more performance in comparison with the dynamic policy. Particularly
as soon as you have many small processes running. The default dynamic
setting can be and was sufficient in most cases. But it's a too general
setting IMO. So to basically get rid of the two static policies, I'm
doing a split of the dynmaic policy into several parts.
</p>
<p>
The dynamic machanisms, either ondemand governor, conservative governor
or the userspace implementation etc. consist each of several different
settings and configuration options like at which load to switch up, how
many steps the mechanism should traverse until reaching max freq and so
on. The SetCPUFreqPerformance method which is available combines all
these setting into one. The performance can be set between 1 and 100.
</p>
<p>
In general it sais, the higher the value the more often and the faster
the frequency is switched up. Each governor has some sort of fixed CPU
load limit (up<sub>threshold</sub>) at which load to switch up frequencies. For
instance, the ondemand governor has the up<sub>threshold</sub> set to 80 by
default. This corresponds to a performance value of 50. As an example,
if you change the performance to 75, the up<sub>threshold</sub> is set to
about 45. So if the CPU load reaches a value higher than 45, the
frequency is switched up. If the up<sub>threshold</sub> would be 80 and a process
would only need 60 percent of CPU, the frequency wouldn't be switched
up. If the performance value would be 1 (lowest performance), the
up<sub>threshold</sub> would be 99. That means that the frequency is really only
increased if you have a process which needs all CPU power (100%, for
instance at compilation time).
</p>
<p>
I will do a small comparison&hellip; Two main situations where policies
differ are
</p>
<ul>
<li>On AC power: You want to do dynamic frequency scaling, but It's not
    that important to reduce power consumption. You want to have the
    maximum performance as soon as you start a process but still want to
    reduce the power drain as soon as the system is idle. (e.g. because
    of thermal reasons). So you need a more aggressive dynamic CPU
    frequency scaling where you switch up sooner and more often. So for
    instance, you set the performance to 75.
</li>
<li>On battery: The primary goal is to increase battery life. But you
    still want a job done as fast as possible as soon there is need to,
    for instance when compiling. So you might want a more tentative
    frequency adjustment. Performance maybe set to 25 in this case.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
The reason why I chose such a fine grained range (from 1 to 100) is to
get an interface that is not limited to only one implementation. For the
CPUFreq case, one can image to have only five steps like min, low,
medium, high, max. But that's something the GUI can and should
decide. It can map these 100 steps to whatever it likes but I don't
think that's the job of the addon. And maybe some system (embedded?,
whatever) likes to have a completely other implementation with 20, 30,
or even 100 steps but still likes to take advantage of the common
interface, it than wouldn't be limited to a predefined range.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, if a policy decision maker (like a GUI) doesn't like to
touch the performance setting, it doesn't need to. It gets a good
default setting. The default is 50 and corresponds to a configuration
which is either the kernel default or which is tested to be stable and
useful for several years now in the userspace case.

<h3 id="sec-1-4">FAQ</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">


<p>
<b>Q:</b> What's the SetCPUFreqConsiderNice setting all about?
</p>
<p>
<b>A:</b> With the ondemand governor this setting is set through
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/ondemand/ignore<sub>nice</sub><sub>load</sub> . The
userspace implementation evaluates the CPU nice load when calculation
the CPU load, too.  It specifies whether niced processes can cause a CPU
frequency increment although they don't really need that much CPU power
and thus wouldn't jump over the UP<sub>THRESHOLD</sub> where frequencies are
usually increased.  It's a policy decision. On AC power for example, you
also want to consider niced processes because switching up CPU
frequencies more often isn't that problematic. In the other case, On
battery, you want a more passive frequency policy and thus you don't
consider niced processes.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q:</b> Why not export a D-Bus interface for each of the processors in the
system?
</p>
<p>
<b>A:</b> I thought about this possibility, too, but came to the conclusion
that it doesn't make sense. There main reasons are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>There are several dependencies between the different CPUs. The
     cpufreq interfaces below <i>sys/devices/system/cpu</i> lists all
     available CPUs, each in one directory. However, you cannot assume
     that you can simply control each CPU through it's single
     interface. There's a file affected<sub>cpus</sub> in each directory listing
     the CPUs which are controlled through this interface. So maybe it
     could look like:
</li>
</ol>


<p>
cpu0/cpufreq/ &ndash;&gt; controls cpu0, cpu1 cpu1/cpufreq/ &ndash;&gt; controls cpu0,
cpu1 &hellip;
</p>
<p>
or: cpu0/cpufreq/ &ndash;&gt; controls cpu0, cpu1, cpu2, cpu3 &hellip;
</p>
<p>
or: cpu0/cpufreq/ &ndash;&gt; only controls cpu0 cpu1/cpufreq/ &ndash;&gt; only controls
cpu1 &hellip;
</p>

<p>
It doesn't make sence to export these dependencies. This would make
things unnecessarily complicated for higher level applications.
</p>
<ol>
<li>I can't imagine a use case were one might want to have different
     settings for different CPUs.
</li>
<li>Some of the cpufreq kernel developers even are agains the
     possibility to set different governors for the CPUs.
</li>
<li>There's a new powernow-k8 driver pending where you only can scale
     all CPUs at a time which would perfectly fit into the current
     desing.
</li>
<li>There's currently no such device object where to export it. There's
     only acpi<sub>CPU</sub>*. Except in very new implementations, in general,
     cpufreq has nothing to do with acpi, it also works with apm or even
     without acpi <span style="text-decoration:underline;">and</span> apm.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
<b>Q:</b> Isn't there a possibility to set the frequency manually?
</p>
<p>
<b>A:</b> No. Usually I'm one of those arguing for having a possibility to
export all possible features to the user on the desktop ;-) But&hellip;  This
doesn't really fit into the concept of this addon. It would be a method
that can only exclusively used if the userspace governor is set. And
that contradics the concept to use common interfaces for all
governors. And to be honest, we all hope that the userspace governor
wouldn't be needed anymore someday. However, it would be possible. It
would need another method SetCPUFreqFrequency and another property
'cpufreq<sub>available</sub><sub>frequencies'</sub>. But I really like to avoid that. This
would also be something which we could add afterwards if it turns out be
be <span style="text-decoration:underline;">really</span> needed.
