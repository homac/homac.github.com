About three weeks ago, something must have happened with my mind. KDE
became too boring, WindowMaker was already gone for some time and I
needed something new. Well, I always used GNOME applications before, I
really like the design and it's the business desktop number one, so I
gave it a try. And I don't mean something like starting it, clicking
around and leaving. This I've already done multiple times like when
testing the gnome-power-manager or other applications. I really ment to
try to get familiar with it and working with it on a daily basis. So I
opened my mind for something which is known as "the bad thing" among KDE
developers
</p>
<p>
After all, I decided to write down everything I would like or
dislike. And now, after 3 weeks of continuous GNOME usage, here are the
results. If anything is wrong, or maybe I just oversaw a gconf key,
please tell me.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-1">Window resizing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">


<p>
The most likely most popular example that also hit me is the not
existing possibility to resize windows with ALT-Right-Click. Well if you
are used to that behaviour, it's really hard to forget this
feature. Additionally, when working in a fast way, moving windows
around, resizing many of them, it's sometimes hard to catch the bottom
right area to bring up an arrow to finally change the size. After one
week or so, I got along with it and it wasn't that painful anymore
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-2">Workspace switching</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">


<p>
I'm used to a one dimensional workspace layout, four workspaces in a
row. And of course, after the last workspace I want to wrap around to
the first. Well, not possible with GNOME. There's already a detailed
bugreport about this issue but was rejected because it would confuse the
users. Oh what a mess. So I changed the layout to have two rows, each
one having two desktops.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3">Icons on the desktop [UPDATE]</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">


<p>
There's no possibility to remove all icons from the desktop, two will
stay there whatever you do. Oh stop, I finally found a possibility,
killing the nautilus process. Unfortunatelly, my desktop wallpaper
disappears, but that's something I can cope with.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for the comments. It is possible to remove the icons,
gconf-editor &ndash;&gt; apps &ndash;&gt; nautilus &ndash;&gt; desktop. Looks easy, so I'm just
too dumb to find it :-)
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-4">Changing the interface language</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">


<p>
If english is not your native language, like in my case, but you still
have to deal with bugreports, reproducing, confirming, etc., you like to
switch the language of the GUIs at runtime. Not possible. You have to
specify the language at login time. But that's one of the smaller
issues, it would just be "nice to have". Nevetheless, annoying.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-5">Bad session management for non-GNOME applications</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">


<p>
One might argue that you simply should use GNOME applications in this
case, but that's not the way I'm working. I use a mixture of all, GNOME,
KDE, QT, tcl applications and so on. Yes, you can't support all crappy
applications, but why isn't emacs recognized at all for example? Just
strange that KDE can handle this.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-6">The hidden monster</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-6">


<p>
Although it has a rather minimalistic style and design (What I really
like actually), it's as slow as KDE. Also the memory usage is as high as
with KDE. I just recall people telling me that C++ applications are a
performance loss&hellip;
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-7">Panel application starter</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-7">


<p>
When invoking the panel application starter with ALT-F2, I can't figure
out the system how applications are stored in the history. I would
expect that if I press the up-arrow-key, the previous executed
application would come up. There's lots of applications in the history,
but not the last or the second to the last. But I really can't say were
the application which come up do come from.
</p>
<p>
And again, this application is so fucking slow. Even on startup. After
typing a command, it seems to be that it has some sort of completion
mechanism and tries to find the corresponding icon for the application
typed. And this can last up to 3 seconds.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-8">Gnome-terminal</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-8">


<p>
My favourite terminal is konsole. Actually I would use xterm if it
wouldn't lose it's focus sometimes when switching workspaces. So it's
some kind of comparison between konsole and the gnome-terminal. Because
if I'm using GNOME, I also want to use its utilities.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Not possible to scroll single lines with shift-up/down
</li>
<li>Not possible to store tabs in profiles
</li>
<li>Just a personal opinion, the tabs on top of the window really look
    ugly ;-)
</li>
<li>Same problem like with workspaces, not possible to wrap around from
    the last tab to the first one
</li>
<li>gnome-terminal seems to be incompatible with some key combinations
    like ALT-. They are not working in the default configuration for zsh
    and irssi. And I wasn't able to change this via the provided menus
    like I can do for konsole.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
All in all, no, gnome-terminal is nothing for me if I like to do
productive working.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-9" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-9">Gaim</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-9">


<p>
On disconnect, for whatever reason (Network, ICQ) , I get a reconnect
window on the desktop which is currently active. But why? My gaim main
window is open on a completely different workspace.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-10" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-10">Conclusion</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-10">


<p>
I really like the look and feel of gtk. It's simple but very nice. And I
really think that the GNOME desktop is better suited for business use or
for unexperienced users in contrast to KDE in its current state. In KDE
the user is striked daed by hundred of menus and settings which is
really confusing in the first place. Although I didn't elaborate these
two advantages much, they are very very strong.
</p>
<p>
I used and worked with it for 3 weeks now. I changed my personal working
behaviour and I really became inured to it. I can work with it now after
adopting to what this desktop (matacity, whatever) pretends. But I think
this is actually the problem. I simply don't want to adopt! That's not
how I see this open source thing these days. If a developer started with
GNOME and got used to it, he wouldn't ever notice that this desktop
doesn't do what he actually wants. He just fits his working behaviour
into the desktop guidelines. If that would be the way he works anyway,
then he's the lucky one. But for anyone else I can't understand how a
developer actually likes to use it. Yes, developing it, extending it,
making it better, but not using it. Everytime I have an idea how to
perfect the way I work a little bit more to get the best out of it, I'm
limited by the desktop. That's not satisfying. So the day before
yesterday, I switched back to KDE although I don't like the look and
feel that much. Fortunately, everybody can make this decision on his
own.
