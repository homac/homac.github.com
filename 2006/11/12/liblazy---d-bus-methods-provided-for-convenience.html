<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
I finally found some time to release <a href="http://liblazy.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software_2fliblazy">liblazy</a> to the public. I'm already
using it in several smaller applications and the KDE kickoff menu links
against it in openSUSE 10.2, so it's some kind of public, but there
hasn't been a place where you can download tarballs or to get further
information. Starting from today, it is hosted on <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org">freedesktop</a> and has a
<a href="http://liblazy.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software_2fliblazy">wiki page</a>.
</p>
<p>
So what's liblazy all about? Liblazy is a simple and easy to use library
that provides convenient functions for sending messages over the D-Bus
daemon, querying information from HAL or asking PolicyKit for a
privilege. Its features may grow as needed, though.
</p>

<h3 id="sec-1-1">Rationale</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">


<p>
Once in a while, I stumble across an application which has no proper
D-Bus support and gathers some information through reading /proc or
sysfs, or any other circumstantial way, although software like HAL or
PolicyKit already have this information. Or they just want to send a
simple message to another application, sometimes even without caring
about the reply. These applications often only have to do very simple
tasks.
</p>
<p>
So to adopt these applications, you always have to duplicate lots of
code over and over again.
</p>
<p>
Just some examples&hellip;
</p>
<p>
To to send a message over D-Bus one has to do:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Get a D-Bus connection
</li>
<li>Check for errors
</li>
<li>Send a message over the bus
</li>
<li>Check for errors
</li>
<li>Get the reply
</li>
<li>Check for errors
</li>
</ol>


<p>
To get a simple property from HAL, one has to do (with libhal in this
example):
</p>
<ol>
<li>Get a D-Bus connection
</li>
<li>Check for errors
</li>
<li>Get a LibHalContext
</li>
<li>C.f.e.
</li>
<li>Register the connection with the context
</li>
<li>C.f.e.
</li>
<li>Fetch the property with libhal
</li>
<li>C.f.e
</li>
</ol>


<p>
When you have to check if your application possess a specific privilege
according to PolicyKit:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Either do a mixture of the above things to ask directly via D-Bus or
    link against libpolkit and do a complicated call of
    libpolkit<sub>is</sub><sub>uid</sub><sub>allowed</sub><sub>for</sub><sub>privilege</sub>(7 arguments follow). This
    call gives you a lot of information you might not care about at all.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
So in every application, you have to implement functions like:
</p>
<ul>
<li>dbus<sub>send</sub><sub>message</sub>(service, path, interface, method);
</li>
<li>dbus<sub>send</sub><sub>message</sub><sub>with</sub><sub>reply</sub>(service, path, interface, method,
    &amp;reply);
</li>
<li>hal<sub>get</sub><sub>property</sub><sub>int</sub>(udi, property)
</li>
<li>&hellip;
</li>
</ul>


<p>
There are a lot of applications which just don't want to care too much
about D-Bus or HAL at all. I'm mostly talking about small applications,
of course, even about those without a mainloop. They just want to make
use of hardware databases and abstractions and a new way of inter
process communication we have with D-Bus these days.
</p>
<p>
So what I've done is combining these very simple functions into one
small library called liblazy. A small application may just want to do
the following to send a message over the bus and get its reply, maybe
even with ignoring any errors:
</p>

<p>
      DBusMessage *reply;
      liblazy<sub>dbus</sub><sub>system</sub><sub>send</sub><sub>method</sub><sub>call</sub>("org.freedesktop.NetworkworkManager",
      "/org/freedesktop/NetworkManager",
      "org.freedesktop.NetworkManager", "sleep", &amp;reply,
      DBUS<sub>TYPE</sub><sub>INVALID</sub>);
</p>
<p>
      int *arg<sub>from</sub><sub>reply</sub>; liblazy<sub>dbus</sub><sub>message</sub><sub>get</sub><sub>arg</sub>(reply,
      DBUS<sub>TYPE</sub><sub>INT32</sub>, &amp;arg<sub>from</sub><sub>reply</sub>, 0);
</p>

<p>
That's it. The application developer just has to link against libdbus
and liblazy, without caring about any other stuff.
</p>
<p>
Liblazy also contains very simple functions to get a property from HAL
or ask for a privilege from PolicyKit. But it doesn't contain complex
functionality. It may grow as needed, though. But&hellip;
</p>
<p>
It is definitely not intended for replacing any of the dbus bindings,
libhal or libpolkit. Complex applications can and will still have their
own implementations and will link agains libhal or libpolkit or
whatever. They are free to use liblazy, of course. But it is definitely
of benefit for small applications which only need a subset of
functionality and like to profit from new software like D-Bus, HAL,
etc. but without having to care a lot. It should serve as a set of
functions for developers provided for convenience. Also a lot more
command line applications could make use of HAL, etc. in an easy way
IMO. Additionally, it may serve as a code example for developers to get
familiar with D-Bus.
</p>
<p>
Most likely, my next blog post will contain something about dockutils, a
framework for getting docking station support for as many notebooks as
possible. But read more next time&hellip;
