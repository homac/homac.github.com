There really happened much the last time, although the last post is
nearly one month ago. Sorry for that (if anyone is interested in what I
am writing at all ;-) The most time consuming was my trip to <a href="http://www.fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a> at
Brussels. I spent much time with the preparations of a talk I had
toghether with Timo Honig about Powermanagement. Slides are already
available at <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/FOSDEM">opensuse wiki</a>. Videos should also be uploaded soon. Hmm,
for me, having a talk in english for the first time, I am satisfied with
the result. We had a little break with technical problems in the middle
of the talk, but all in all, it was ok. I mean, for a kraut having a
talk in english the first time in his life, I did not expect more ;-)
But the even more important impressions were the people I met. I met
Fred Blaise (<a href="http://madpenguin.org/blogs/chapeaurouge/">blog</a>, yes, he has one, unlike Timo ;-) ). a friend of Timo
from France, aehm, the USA, Belgium or whatever ;-). I really hope to
meet him again some day, having a beer, or two, or three&hellip; Dominic
Rath, also a friend of Timo gave a talk in the embedded devel room. I'm
still not sure what he was exactly talking about, but the other embedded
freaks listening seemed to be really impressed ;-) Back in Nurnberg, the
main thing I've done is maintaining the powersave daemon. And I mean
real maintenance. Not much development, only integrating patches,
branching, merging, releasing and so on. We have know support for
suspend2 and the socalled hibernate scripts out of the
box. Unfortunately, it seems too late to get the Powersave daemon as a
default powermanagement solution for the Ubuntu Dapper release. That
would really be great and I would like to help in any regard to make
this possible. But it's not my decision ;-) I'm also currently
evaluating multicore support for Powersave. Many of the newer laptops
are shipped with two cores already, and it will become even more
important in the future. So it would be great to have only one core
activated when running on battery and having full power when running on
ac. Hopefully I will find some time for integration into the Powersave
schemes soon. Finally, again promising that I will blog more regulary in
future, don't forget to have a lot of fun! Holger
